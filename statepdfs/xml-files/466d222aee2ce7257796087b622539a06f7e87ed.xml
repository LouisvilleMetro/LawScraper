If a person dies as a result of intentionally causing or attempting to cause injury to himself, his survivors are not entitled to basic or added reparation benefits for loss arising from his death. A person intentionally causes or attempts to cause injury if he acts or fails to act for the purpose of causing injury. A person does not intentionally cause or attempt to cause injury merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or if the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person.  </text><history>Created 1974 Ky.

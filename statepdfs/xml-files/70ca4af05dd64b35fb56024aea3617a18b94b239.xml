When in pursuit of any offender for any offense committed within his jurisdiction, any such officer may follow and effect an arrest beyond the limits of his jurisdiction. If the arrest be made without warrant, the accused may elect to be immediately taken before the nearest court having jurisdiction, whereupon it shall be the duty of the officer to so take him. If the accused elects not to be so taken, then it shall be the duty of the officer to require of the accused a bail-bond in a sum not less than one hundred dollars ($100), conditioned that the accused binds himself to appear in the court of jurisdiction at the time fixed in the bond, not however in any case later than six (6) days from the day of arrest. In case the arrested person fails to appear on the day fixed, the bond shall be forfeited in the manner as is provided for the forfeiture of bonds in other cases. No officer shall be permitted to take a cash bond. The officer making the arrest and taking the bond shall report the same to the court having jurisdiction within eighteen (18) hours after taking such bond. </text><history>Amended 1974 Ky.

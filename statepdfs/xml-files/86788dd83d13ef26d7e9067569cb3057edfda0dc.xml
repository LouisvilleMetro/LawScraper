Acts ch. 51, sec. 183, provides, "The specific textual provisions of Sections 1 to 178 of this Act which reflect amendments made to those sections by 2007 Ky. Acts ch. 137 shall be deemed effective as of June 26, 2007, and those provisions are hereby made expressly retroactive to that date, with the remainder of the text of those sections being unaffected by the provisions of this section." (6/28/2006).  2006 (1st Extra Sess.) Ky. Acts ch. 2, sec. 73, provides that "unless a provision of this Act specifically applies to an earlier tax year, the provisions of this Act shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2007." (7/12/2006).  In 2006 Ky. Acts ch. 149, almost all references in the Kentucky Revised Statutes to "registered limited liability partnerships" were removed by amendments to various sections of the KRS. However, in this section and in sec. 216 of the bill, KRS 154.22-010, this phrase was not changed or deleted. It appears that leaving this phrase in these two sections was an oversight.  (7/12/2006).  A reference in subsection (3)(a) of this section has been corrected in codification to read "subsection (8)(b)4." because the necessary adjustments to this internal reference were not made in either 2002 Ky. Acts ch. 338, sec. 25, or 2006 Ky. Acts ch. 149, sec 217, each of which inserted a new subsection into this statute. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected these oversights under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(e) and (h). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-01</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:55</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=2756</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

Acts ch. 119, sec. 26, provides that the amendments to this statute in 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 119, sec. 6, shall apply to property assessed on or after January 1, 2014. (1/1/2014). This statute was amended by 2013 Ky. Acts chs. 40 and 119, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.  (7/15/2010).  Under the authority of KRS 7.136, the Reviser of Statutes has corrected manifest clerical or typographical errors by inserting "a" before the first occurrence of "charter county government" and "the" before "legislative body" and "chief executive officer" in subsection (23) of this section.  (6/26/2007).  A manifest clerical or typographical error in subsection (21)(f)2. has been corrected by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS 7.136.  (6/20/2005).  2005 Ky. Acts ch. 168, sec. 170, provided: "Subsection (18) of Section 54 of this Act, relating to property tax changes, take[s] effect January 1, 2006. Subsection (19) of Section 54 of this Act, relating to the voluntary environmental remediation credit, takes effect January 1, 2005." Because of the order in which the subsections become effective, the Statute Reviser, under the authority of KRS 7.136, has codified subsection (18) of Section 54, relating to property tax changes, as KRS 132.010(19), and subsection (19) of Section 54, relating to the voluntary remediation credit, as KRS 132.010(18). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:00</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=42716</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

Provided, however, that any source of funding approved by the electorate in connection with the approval of such a mass transportation program shall not, as a result of such permissive funding by any such public body from other legally available sources, be rendered void or nugatory. </section><section prefix="3">Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary any transit authority created pursuant to this chapter may enter into agreements with the Commonwealth or agency thereof for the transportation of governmental employees to and from work stations located within or outside the authority's transit area. For the purposes of this subsection the Commonwealth may provide demonstration funds to encourage commuter transportation for its employees. These funds shall be limited to one (1) year of operation of new routes and shall not be used to subsidize the individual governmental employee's cost of transportation. </section></text><history>Amended 1980 Ky.

Acts ch. 165, sec. 28, effective July 15, 1994. -- Created 1978 Ky.

Acts chs. 165 and 329 are in conflict in where responsibility for regulation of sale of business opportunities is placed, and ch. 329 has prevailed as the last enactment under KRS 446.250. Because of this, a change from "division" to "department" in this statute under ch. 165 has not been codified. See KRS 7.136(2). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:41</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=35070</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

Acts ch. 417, sec. 18, was met, the voters of the Commonwealth having ratified at the general election on November 7, 2000, a constitutional amendment (see 2000 Ky. Acts ch. 399) abolishing the Railroad Commission. (7/15/98).  A reference to "KRS 11A.010(9)(a) to (i)" in the former subsection (6) of this statute (now subsection (7)) has been changed in codification to "KRS 11A.010(9)(a) to (h)" under KRS 7.136(1)(e) and (h). 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 429, sec. 1, eliminated the former paragraph (g) of KRS 11A.010(9) and renumbered the remaining subsections accordingly. Other actions within Acts Chapter 429 used the "(a) to (h)" range in new language and modified existing language to use the "(a) to (h)" range. It seems clear from context, and this has been confirmed by the drafter of the bill, that this change was intended here as well but was inadvertently overlooked. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-01</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:15</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=594</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

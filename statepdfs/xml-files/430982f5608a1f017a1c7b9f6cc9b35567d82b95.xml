To assist the commission in the determination of administrative practicability and feasibility, the commission shall, within a reasonable time after entry of the finding that there is need for the organization of the district and the determination of the boundaries of the district, hold a referendum within the proposed district upon the proposition of the creation of the district, and cause due notice of the referendum to be given. The question shall be submitted to the voters in the following form: "For creation of a soil conservation district of the lands below described and lying in the County (or Counties) of ...., ...., and ...." and "Against creation of a soil conservation district of the lands below described and lying in the County (or Counties) of ...., and ....." The voter shall be instructed to vote "yes" for one or the other of the propositions, as the voter may favor or oppose creation of the district. The boundaries of the proposed district as determined by the commission shall be set forth. Only owners of lands lying within the boundaries of the territory, as determined by the commission, shall be eligible to vote in the referendum. </text><history>Amended 1982 Ky.

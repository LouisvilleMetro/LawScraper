The board of trustees shall offer coverage to the disabled child of an annuitant regardless of the disabled child's age if the annuitant pays the entire premium for the disabled child's coverage. A child shall be considered disabled if he has been determined to be eligible for federal Social Security disability benefits. </section><section prefix="b">Individuals who become members of the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System on or after July 1, 2008, shall not be eligible for benefits under this section unless the member has at least fifteen (15) or more years of service credited under KRS 161.500 or another state-administered retirement system. </section></section><section prefix="3">All expenses for benefits under this section shall be paid from the funding provisions contained in KRS 161.420(5), from a trust fund established by the board under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115, premium charges received from the annuitants and the spouses, and from funds that may be appropriated or allocated by statute. </section><section prefix="4"><section prefix="a">The board of trustees shall determine the amount of health insurance supplement payments that the Teachers' Retirement System will provide to assist eligible annuitants in paying the cost of their health insurance, based on the funds available in the medical insurance fund and any trust fund established by the board for this purpose under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115.

Monthly health insurance supplement payments made by the retirement system may not exceed the amount of the single coverage insurance premium chosen by the eligible annuitants. In order to qualify for health insurance supplements, the annuitant must agree to pay the difference between the insurance premium and the applicable supplement payment, by payroll deduction from his retirement allowance, or by a payment method approved by the retirement system. </section><section prefix="b">The board shall, effective July 1, 2010, have the authority to charge retired members who are not paying the Standard Medicare Part B premium an amount equal to the Standard Medicare Part B premium in addition to any other payments determined by the board to be necessary to contain costs within the available funding. If the board determines that retired members who are not paying the Standard Medicare Part B premium should pay the equivalent of the Standard Medicare Part B premium, the board shall phase in the premium according to the following schedule: July 1, 2010............. .................................................. Thirty-three percent (33%) July 1, 2011........ ....................................................... Sixty-seven percent (67%) July 1, 2012, and thereafter ...................................

Recipients of a retirement allowance from the retirement system must agree to pay the cost of this coverage by payroll deduction from their retirement allowance or by a payment method approved by the retirement system. </section><section prefix="d">The board of trustees shall offer, on a full-cost basis, health insurance coverage provided by the retirement system to the disabled child of an annuitant, regardless of the age of the disabled child.

The board may provide insurance coverage by making payment to insurance carriers including health insurance plans that are available to active and retired state employees and active teachers, institutions, and individuals for services performed, or the board of trustees may elect to provide insurance on a "self-insurance" basis or a combination of these provisions. </section><section prefix="6">The board of trustees may approve health insurance supplement payments to eligible annuitants who are less than sixty-five (65) years of age, as reimbursement for hospital and medical insurance premiums made by annuitants for their individual coverage.

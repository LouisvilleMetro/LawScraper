ARTICLE VIII Rules and Operating Procedures: Rulemaking Functions of the Commission Rulemaking functions of the Commission: 1. Rulemaking Authority.â€”The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. 2. Rulemaking Procedure.â€”Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act," of 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. 3. Effective Date - All Rules and amendments, thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each Rule, operating procedure or amendment. 4. Not later than thirty (30) days after a Rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the Rule; provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the Rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the Petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the Rule to be unlawful if the Rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Commissionâ€™s authority. ARTICLE IX Commission Records and Enforcement 1. The Commission shall promulgate Rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals, insurers, insureds or Surplus Lines Licensee trade secrets. State Transaction Documentation and Clearinghouse Transaction Data collected by the Clearinghouse shall be used for only those purposes expressed in or reasonably implied under the provisions of this Compact and the Commission shall afford this data the broadest protections as permitted by any applicable law for proprietary information, trade secrets or personal data. The Commission may promulgate additional Rules under which it may make available to federal and State agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions. 2. Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any Compacting State pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any Compacting State Member of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the Commission; provided that disclosure to the Commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement, and further provided that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, the Commission shall not be subject to the Compacting Stateâ€™s laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the Commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any Member, and the Commission shall maintain the confidentiality of any information provided by a member that is confidential under that Memberâ€™s State Law. 3. The Commission shall monitor Compacting States for compliance with duly adopted Bylaws and Rules. The Commission shall notify any non-complying Compacting State in writing of its noncompliance with Commission Bylaws or Rules. If a non-complying Compacting State fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the Compacting State shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV. ARTICLE X Dispute Resolution 1. Before a Member may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the Compact, the Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a Member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this Compact and which may arise between two or more Compacting States, Contracting States or Non-Compacting States, and the Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing alternative dispute resolution procedures for such disputes. 2. The Commission shall also provide alternative dispute resolution procedures to resolve any disputes between insureds or Surplus Lines Licensees concerning a tax calculation or allocation or related issues which are the subject of this Compact. 3. Any alternative dispute resolution procedures shall be utilized in circumstances where a dispute arises as to which State constitutes the Home State. ARTICLE XI Review of Commission Decisions Regarding Commission decisions: 1. Except as necessary for promulgating Rules to fulfill the purposes of this Compact, the Commission shall not have authority to otherwise regulate insurance in the Compacting States. 2. Not later than thirty (30) days after the Commission has given notice of any Rule or Allocation Formula, any third party filer or Compacting State may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the Commission, in making compliance or tax determinations acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with Article III, Section 6. 3. The Commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider Commission decisions upon a finding that the determinations or allocations do not meet the relevant Rule. Where appropriate, the Commission may withdraw or modify its determination or allocation after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in Section 2 above. ARTICLE XII Finance 1. The Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations the Commission may accept contributions, grants, and other forms of funding from the State stamping offices, Compacting States and other sources. 2. The Commission shall collect a fee payable by the insured directly or through a Surplus Lines Licensee on each transaction processed through the Compact Clearinghouse, to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the Commissionâ€™s annual budget. 3. The Commissionâ€™s budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in Article VIII of this Compact. 4. The Commission shall be regarded as performing essential governmental functions in exercising such powers and functions and in carrying out the provisions of this Compact and of any law relating thereto, and shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments of any character, levied by any State or political subdivision thereof, upon any of the property used by it for such purposes, or any income or revenue therefrom, including any profit from a sale or exchange. 5. The Commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements for all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the Commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its Bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the Commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. Upon the determination of the Commission, but not less frequently than every three (3) years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the Commission. The Commission shall make an annual report to the Governor and legislature of the Compacting States, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The Commissionâ€™s internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the Commissioner, the controller, or the stamping office of any Compacting State upon request provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals, and licenseesâ€™ and insurersâ€™ proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential. 6. No Compacting State shall have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the Commission or to any Commission funds held pursuant to the provisions of this Compact. 7. The Commission shall not make any political contributions to candidates for elected office, elected officials, political parties nor political action committees. The Commission shall not engage in lobbying except with respect to changes to this Compact. ARTICLE XIII Compacting States, Effective Date and Amendment 1. Any State is eligible to become a Compacting State. 2. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by two (2) Compacting States, provided the Commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting Rules, and creating the Clearinghouse when there are a total of ten (10) Compacting States and Contracting States or, alternatively, when there are Compacting States and Contracting States representing greater than forty percent (40%) of the Surplus Lines Insurance premium volume based on records of the percentage of Surplus Lines Insurance premium set forth in Appendix A hereto. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other Compacting State upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Clearinghouse operations and the duty to report Clearinghouse Transaction Data shall begin on the first January 1st or July 1st following the first anniversary of the Commission effective date. For States which join the Compact subsequent to the effective date, a start date for reporting Clearinghouse Transaction Data shall be set by the Commission provided Surplus Lines Licensees and all other interested parties receive not less than 90 days advance notice. 3. Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Commission and the Compacting States unless and until all Compacting States enact the amendment into law. ARTICLE XIV Withdrawal, Default and Termination 1. Withdrawal a. Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State, provided that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact ("Withdrawing State") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law. b. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any tax or compliance determinations approved on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State unless the approval is rescinded by the Commission. c. The Member of the Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Executive Committee of the Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. d. The Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the introduction of such legislation within ten (10) days after its receipt of notice thereof. e. The Withdrawing State is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. To the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State, the Commissionâ€™s determinations prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the Withdrawing State, unless formally rescinded by the Commission. f. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the effective date of the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact. 2. Default a. If the Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted ("Defaulting State") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or duly promulgated Rules then after notice and hearing as set forth in the Bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact on the Defaulting State shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the Commission. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in Commission Rules. The Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the Defaulting Stateâ€™s suspension pending a cure of the default. The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Commission, the Defaulting State shall be terminated from the Compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. b. Decisions of the Commission that are issued on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the Defaulting State in the same manner as if the Defaulting State had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to Section 1 of this Article. c. Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires a reenactment of the Compact. 3. Dissolution of Compact a. The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State. b. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall have no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Rules and Bylaws. ARTICLE XV Severability and Construction 1. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable. 2. The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes. 3. Throughout this Compact the use of the singular shall include the plural and vice-versa. 4. The headings and captions of articles, sections and sub-sections used in this Compact are for convenience only and shall be ignored in construing the substantive provisions of this Compact. ARTICLE XVI Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws 1. Other Laws a. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State except as provided in Paragraph b. of this section. b. Decisions of the Commission, and any Rules, and any other requirements of the Commission shall constitute the exclusive Rule, or determination applicable to the Compacting States. Any law or regulation regarding Non-Admitted Insurance of Multi-State Risks that is contrary to Rules of the Commission is preempted with respect to the following: (i) Clearinghouse Transaction Data reporting requirements; (ii) Allocation Formula; (iii) Clearinghouse Transaction Data collection requirements; (iv) Premium Tax payment time frames and Rules concerning dissemination of data among the Compacting States for Non-Admitted Insurance of Multi-State Risks and Single-State Risks; (v) exclusive compliance with surplus lines law of the Home State of the insured; (vi) Rules for reporting to a Clearinghouse for receipt and distribution of Clearinghouse Transaction Data related to Non-Admitted Insurance of Multi-State Risks; (vii) Uniform foreign Insurers Eligibility Requirements; (viii) Uniform Policyholder Notice; and (ix) Uniform treatment of Purchasing Groups procuring Non-Admitted Insurance. c. Except as stated in paragraph b, any Rule, Uniform Standard or other requirement of the Commission shall constitute the exclusive provision that a Commissioner may apply to compliance or tax determinations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action taken by the Commission shall abrogate or restrict: (i) the access of any person to State courts; (ii) the availability of alternative dispute resolution under Article X of this Compact (iii) remedies available under State law related to breach of contract, tort, or other laws not specifically directed to compliance or tax determinations; (iv) State law relating to the construction of insurance contracts; or (v) the authority of the attorney general of the State, including but not limited to maintaining any actions or proceedings, as authorized by law. 2. Binding Effect of this Compact a. All lawful actions of the Commission, including all Rules promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States, except as provided herein. b. All agreements between the Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms. c. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation in dispute. This provision may be implemented by Rule at the discretion of the Commission. d. In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by that provision upon the Commission shall be ineffective as to that State and those obligations duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.

Acts ch. 48, sec. 1, effective June 8, 2011. </history><metadata><effective> June 8, 2011 </effective><lrc-note>(6/8/2011).  As enacted, 2011 Ky. Acts ch. 48, sec. 1, directed that a new section of KRS 304.010 to 304.210 be created. However, KRS Chapter 304 contains no current statutes, as they were repealed, reenacted, and renumbered as sections of subtitles of KRS Chapter 304. Subtitle 10 of KRS Chapter 304 relates to surplus lines insurance and is numbered KRS 304.10-010 to 304.10-210. The Reviser of Statutes has codified this section as a new section of Subtitle 10 of KRS Chapter 304 under the authority of KRS 7.136.  (6/8/2011).  2011 Ky. Acts ch. 48, sec. 5, provided that the provisions contained in Sections 2, 3, and 4 of that Act "shall take effect as provided in Article XIII of Section 1 of this Act, upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by two compacting states, provided the commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting rules, and creating the clearinghouse when there are a total of ten compacting states and contracting states or, alternatively, when there are compacting states and contracting states representing greater than 40 percent of the surplus lines insurance premium volume based on records of the percentage of surplus lines insurance." The Reviser of Statutes has determined that, as of April 8, 2011, two states had enacted the compact, thereby triggering the initial effective date of the compact. Since 2011 Ky. Acts ch. 48, did not contain an emergency clause, this section became effective June 8, 2011, the normal effective date for 2011 legislation.</lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-03</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:12</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39726</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

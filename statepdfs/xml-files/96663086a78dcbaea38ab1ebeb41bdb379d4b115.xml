The database shall be accessible to the department and the deferred deposit service business licensee to verify whether any deferred deposit transactions are outstanding for a particular person. A deferred deposit service business licensee shall accurately and promptly submit such data before entering into each deferred deposit transaction in such format as the commissioner may require by rule or order, including the customer's name, Social Security number or employment authorization alien number, address, driver's license number, amount of the transaction, date of transaction, date that the completed transaction is closed, and any additional information required by the commissioner. The commissioner may adopt rules to administer and enforce the provisions of this subtitle and to assure that the database is used by deferred deposit service business licensees in accordance with this subtitle. </section><section prefix="2">The commissioner shall impose a fee of one dollar ($1) per transaction for data required to be submitted by a deferred deposit service business licensee, which fee may be charged to the customer. </section><section prefix="3">The commissioner may operate the database described in subsection (1) of this section or may select and contract with a third-party provider to operate the database.

The third-party provider shall remit the fee collected from the licensee to the commissioner no later than the first day of each month. The third-party provider shall deposit any fee collected in a separate escrow account in a federally insured financial institution and shall hold the fee deposited in trust for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. </section></section><section prefix="4">The database described in subsection (1) of this section shall allow a deferred deposit service business licensee accessing the database to do all of the following: <section prefix="a">Verify whether a customer has any open deferred deposit transactions with any deferred deposit business service licensee that have not been closed; </section><section prefix="b">Provide information necessary to ensure deferred deposit service business licensee compliance with any requirements imposed by the United States Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control and United States Treasury Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; and </section><section prefix="c">Track and monitor the number of customers who notify a deferred deposit service business licensee of violations of this subtitle, the number of times a deferred deposit service business licensee agreed that a violation occurred, the number of times that a deferred deposit service business licensee did not agree that a violation occurred, the amount of restitution paid, and any other information the commissioner requires by rule or order. </section></section><section prefix="5">While operating the database, the database provider shall do all of the following: <section prefix="a">Establish and maintain a process for responding to transaction verification requests due to technical difficulties occurring with the database that prevent the licensee from accessing the database through the Internet; </section><section prefix="b">Comply with any applicable federal and state provisions to prevent identity theft; </section><section prefix="c">Provide accurate and secure receipt, transmission, and storage of customer data; and </section><section prefix="d">Meet the requirements of this subtitle. </section></section><section prefix="6">When the database provider receives notification that a deferred deposit service transaction has been closed, the database provider shall designate the transaction as closed in the database immediately, but in no event after 11:59 p.m. on the day the commissioner or database provider receives notification. </section><section prefix="7">The database provider shall automatically designate a deferred deposit service transaction as closed in the database five (5) days after the transaction maturity date unless a deferred deposit service business licensee reports to the database provider before that time that the transaction remains open because of the customer's failure to make payment; that the transaction is open because the customer's payment instrument or an electronic redeposit is in the process of clearing the banking system; or that the transaction remains open because the customer's payment instrument is being returned to the deferred deposit service business licensee for insufficient funds, a closed account, or a stop payment order; or because of any other factors determined by the commissioner.

If the plan is disapproved, the deferred deposit service business licensee may submit a new plan or may submit a modified plan for the deferred deposit service business licensee to follow. If at any time the commissioner reasonably determines that a deferred deposit service business licensee that has stopped offering deferred deposit service transactions is not updating the database in accordance with its approved plan, the commissioner shall immediately close or instruct the database provider to immediately close all remaining open transactions of that deferred deposit service business licensee. </section><section prefix="9">The response to an inquiry to the database provider by a deferred deposit service business licensee shall state only that a person is eligible or ineligible for a new deferred deposit service transaction and describe the reason for that determination.

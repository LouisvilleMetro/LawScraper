Subpoenas may be issued by the chairman or the majority of the members of the commission and shall be served in the same manner as subpoenas for witnesses in civil cases. All provisions of law relative to subpoenas issued in such cases, including compensation of witnesses, shall apply to subpoenas issued by the commission. Upon petition by the commission, any Circuit Court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is being carried on may, in case of refusal to obey a subpoena or order of the commission, issue an order requiring compliance.

The amount of the account subject to set-off is that proportion to which the debtor is, or was immediately before his death, beneficially entitled, and in the absence of actual knowledge of net contributions by the financial institution, to an equal share with all parties having present rights of withdrawal without the joinder of any other party.  </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

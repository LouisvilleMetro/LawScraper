For the purpose of this section, property shall be deemed to have been abandoned when the mortgagor has moved from the property and when by the nature of the property in question when further neglect or failure to attend will decrease its value. Any right a mortgagee acquires in a tenant's interest in crops raised on shares is inferior to any prior existing lien of the landlord on the tenant's interest. Nothing in this section shall be construed as conflicting with the provisions of KRS 383.110 or 426.205. </text><history>Amended 2012 Ky.

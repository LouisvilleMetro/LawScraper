The prior reference to KRS 396.025 near the beginning of this statute was the result of an apparent inadvertent transposition of digits in codifying. See 1988 Ky. Acts Ch. 90, Â§Â§ 30 and 26. Pursuant to KRS 7.136, the text of this statute has been corrected to reflect the appropriate cross reference to KRS 396.205. </lrc-note><note> 1980 Ky. Acts ch. 396, sec. 141 would have amended this section effective July 1, 1982. However, 1980 Ky. Acts ch. 396 was repealed by 1982 Ky. Acts ch. 141, sec. 146, also effective July 1, 1982. </note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:30</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=43545</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

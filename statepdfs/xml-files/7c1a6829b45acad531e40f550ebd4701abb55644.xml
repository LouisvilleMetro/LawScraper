Each joint owner of property shall be counted as a separate freeholder. </section><section prefix="2">In determining when seventy percent (70%) of the landowners have signed the petition the secretary shall consult with the landowners whose names appear upon the county tax duplicate, which for all purposes of KRS 104.450 to 104.680 shall be prima facie evidence of such ownership. The secretary shall further require evidence to determine the fact that all signatures on the petition are genuine, and a notification by ordinary mail sent to the respective addresses shown on the petition shall establish the genuineness of a signature if the petitioner so notified fails to report in writing within ten (10) days that he did not sign the petition. When authorized by ordinance, such a petition may be signed by a majority of the governing body of any municipality lying wholly or partly within the proposed district. When so signed by a majority of such governing body the petition shall fill all requirements of representation on the part of the freeholders of the municipality as they appear upon the assessment roll of the municipality, and individuals within the municipality shall not sign the petition. </section></text><history>Amended 1982 Ky.

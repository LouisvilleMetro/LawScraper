The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall in each instance be payable solely from a special fund provided for the payment, with revenues derived from water use fees collected from all facilities using water from the Kentucky River basin, except those facilities using water primarily for agricultural purposes, pledged to be set aside and deposited in such special fund. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more such series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding the thirtieth anniversary of their respective dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of bonds including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile thereof shall be affixed thereto and attested by the manual signature of the treasurer of the authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall have and are hereby declared to have all qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the uniform commercial code of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell such bonds at public sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of KRS 151.720. </section><section prefix="2">The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such a manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for such bonds or any account or accounts therein as the authority shall have provided in the proceedings or trust indenture authorizing and securing such bonds. </section><section prefix="3">Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. </section><section prefix="4">The authority may issue revenue bond anticipation notes. </section><section prefix="5">Any holder of bonds issued under the provisions of this section or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under any trust indenture, except to the extent of the rights given in this section, may be restricted by such trust indenture or proceedings, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the Commonwealth or granted under this section or under such trust indenture or the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such trust indenture or proceedings to be performed by the authority or by any officer or employee thereof. </section><section prefix="6">Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall not be a debt, liability, or obligation of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof and shall not be a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof. </section><section prefix="7">Revenue bonds issued by the authority shall be subject to the jurisdiction and approval of the State Property and Buildings Commission and the Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee and shall be subject to review by the Office of Financial Management established in KRS 42.0201. </section><section prefix="8">The authority shall not be required to pay any taxes and assessments to the Commonwealth or any county, municipality, or other governmental subdivision of the Commonwealth upon any of its property or upon its obligations or other evidences of indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this section, or upon any moneys, funds, revenues, or other income held or received by the authority and the bonds or notes of the authority and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation, except for death and gift taxes and taxes of transfers. </section><section prefix="9">Contractual expenses to construct, reconstruct, provide for the major maintenance, or repair the Kentucky River locks and dams, or to maintain the channel, or to acquire real or personal property pertaining thereto, or to construct, reconstruct, maintain, or repair such property, shall be paid from the proceeds of the revenue bonds.

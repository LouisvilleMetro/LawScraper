This is intended to be done by extending to a planning commission in counties containing a consolidated local government the authority to issue remedial orders and impose civil fines in order to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective, and inexpensive method of ensuring compliance with approved land use plans as they apply to binding element agreements. KRS 100.401 to 100.419 is intended and shall be construed to provide an additional or supplemental means of obtaining compliance with local zoning ordinances and nothing contained in KRS 100.401 to 100.419 shall prohibit the enforcement of local zoning ordinances by any other means authorized by law. </text><history> Amended 2014 Ky.

If the policy, contract, or plan permits, payment may be made directly to the provider of the services. If the plan does not permit direct provider reimbursement, the person entitled to these benefits shall be entitled to reimbursement for the cost of services received. Nothing in this section shall require an individual health insurance policy which places the insured within a preferred or exclusive provider arrangement to cover services by a provider with whom the insurer does not have a contract, or to make payment of or reimbursement for the cost of any service which exceeds the limits of the policy. </text><history> Created 1994 Ky.

No natural area shall be construed to be unworthy of preservation because it is not included in the register.  Publication of the register is notice to all public agencies that the registered natural areas are worthy of preservation.  No area so registered shall be a nature preserve unless and until it shall have been dedicated as provided for in KRS 146.410 to 146.530. </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

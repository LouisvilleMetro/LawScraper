The interest of the Commonwealth requires that such transitions be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the affairs of the state government. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the Commonwealth and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in KRS 11.210 to 11.260 directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the General Assembly that all officers of the state government so conduct the affairs of the state government for which they exercise responsibility and authority as to be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of Governor, to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power and otherwise to promote orderly transitions in the office of Governor. </text><history>Created 1972 Ky.

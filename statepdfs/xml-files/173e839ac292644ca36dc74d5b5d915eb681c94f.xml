If judgment is rendered for the plaintiff in any case provided for in those sections and it is afterwards reversed or arrested so that the plaintiff takes nothing by it, he may commence another action within one (1) year thereafter. If the surety absconds, conceals himself or by removal from the state or otherwise, obstructs or hinders his being sued the time of such obstruction shall not be counted as part of the time of limitation allowed by those sections. If the judgment is obstructed by appeal, supersedeas or injunction the time of such obstruction shall also be disallowed. </text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky.

The deposition of such witness shall be taken and certified as depositions are taken in other cases, except that no notice need be given of the time and place of taking, unless the probate is opposed by some person who has made himself a party. The proof so given shall have the same effect as if it had been given in the court from which the commission issued. </text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky.

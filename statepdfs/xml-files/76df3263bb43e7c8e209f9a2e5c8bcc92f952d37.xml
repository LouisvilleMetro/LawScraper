The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court. </section><section prefix="2">The military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may change the ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in KRS 35.260, beginning with the junior in rank. </section><section prefix="3">Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them: <section prefix="a">That the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt; </section><section prefix="b">That in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt shall be resolved in favor of the accused and he shall be acquitted; </section><section prefix="c">That if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and </section><section prefix="d">That the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is upon the state. </section></section><section prefix="4">Subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only.

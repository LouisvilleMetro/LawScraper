In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked shall be added to principal. </section><section prefix="3">When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate, or other tax requirements. The settlor may change the charitable beneficiary of a trust by will or through written notice to trustee, or may decline to make a change in like manner, so long as the change does not alter the income, gift, estate, or other tax benefits available under the terms of the trust. </section></text><history> Created 2004 Ky.

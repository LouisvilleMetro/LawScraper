The General Assembly also finds that assisting small businesses in complying with other environmental protection regulatory programs would complement this assistance. It is therefore in the best interest of Kentucky small businesses, as well as the citizens of Kentucky, to establish a program whose purpose is to advise small businesses on all environmental protection regulatory programs as well as the requirements of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act permitting program and to assist these small businesses in complying with these requirements. </text><history> Amended 1998 Ky.

Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to release the property valuation administrator or anyone else from performing his duties in accordance with the requirements of the law. Even though the assessing officer may not have complied literally with all the provisions of the statutes no taxpayer shall be entitled to a final abatement of the taxes by injunction or otherwise on any part of a final assessment unless the taxpayer shows that the assessment was excessive or discriminatory or that the property was not taxable. </text><history>Created 1942 Ky.

The active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, and the military reserves are providing burial honors details as available manpower permits. Year 2000 data from the Department of Defense shows over 497,000 veterans died, but only 91,074 military funeral honors were performed. Although the veterans' service organizations provide untold thousands of unofficial services, many Kentucky veterans are still being buried without honors, including firing details, color guard, and pallbearers. </section><section prefix="2">To correct this situation, the Department of Veterans' Affairs shall oversee a Veterans' Service Organization Burial Honor Guard Program. </section><section prefix="3">The Department of Veterans' Affairs shall implement and administer the provisions of this section through the promulgation of administrative regulations. These regulations shall be in accordance with the provisions of KRS Chapter 13A. </section></text><history> Created 2002 Ky.

A reference to "Section 8 of this Act" in 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 91, sec. 8, subsec. 2, which became subsection (2) of this statute, has been codified as "KRS 304.49-110" (Section 7 of that Act) to correct a manifest oversight during the amendment process. House Floor Amendment 1 to House Bill 241, which became 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 91, deleted Section 2 in its entirety and renumbered the subsequent sections, but did not make the conforming change to the reference in subsection (2). This manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS 7.136(1). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:57</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=30230</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

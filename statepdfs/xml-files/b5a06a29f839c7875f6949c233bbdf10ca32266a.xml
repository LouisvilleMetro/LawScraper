If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing, and eligible to serve was nominated under KRS 385.032, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under KRS 385.032; otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under KRS 385.092(1). The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian. </section><section prefix="2">A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under KRS 385.042 as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor.

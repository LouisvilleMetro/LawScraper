Acts ch. 165, sec. 13, provided that this statute be created as a new section of KRS Chapter 344A. However, since there is currently no KRS Chapter 344A, and since all other newly created statutes in this Act are to be placed in KRS Chapter 334A, the Reviser of Statutes has sited this statute in KRS Chapter 334A, under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a).  (7/15/2008).  Two manifest clerical or typographical errors have been corrected in this statute during codification under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:56</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=31904</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

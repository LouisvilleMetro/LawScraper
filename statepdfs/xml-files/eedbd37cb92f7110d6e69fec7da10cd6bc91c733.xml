This section was repealed in 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, sec. 179, effective July 15, 2010. However, 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, sec. 180, provides that "The repeals set out in Section 179 of this Act are hereby expressly made retroactive to the first moment of June 26, 2007." That language, therefore, applies to this section, and the repeal will be applied retroactively to affirm the repeal of this section contained in 2007 Ky. Acts ch. 137, sec. 181, effective June 26, 2007. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:42</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=34389</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

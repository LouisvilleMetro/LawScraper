Acts ch. 128, sec. 8 provides that the amendments to this statute made in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 128, sec. 5, shall apply to property assessed on or after January 1, 2015.  (1/1/2014).  2013 Ky. Acts ch. 119, sec. 26, provides that the amendments to this statute in 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 119, sec. 8, shall apply to property assessed on or after January 1, 2014. (1/1/2014).  2013 Ky. Acts ch. 119, sec. 24, provides, "It is the intent of the General Assembly that the changes made in [this statute and KRS 132.020], relating to tangible personal property which has been certified as a pollution control facility, are to clarify existing provisions in the law, as follows:  (1) That the tax rate of fifteen cents ($0.15) upon each one hundred dollars ($100) of value only applies to tangible personal property which has been certified as a pollution control facility; and   (2) That only tangible personal property certified as a pollution control facility is subject to taxation for state purposes only while being exempt from taxation in the county, city, school, or other taxing district in which it has a taxable situs."  (6/8/2011).  The Reviser of Statutes has corrected a manifest clerical or typographical error in subsection (16) of this statute by changing the citation at the end of that subsection from "KRS 139.010" to "KRS 365.800." This error occurred during the merger of amendments to this statute in 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 81, sec. 1, and ch. 95, sec. 18.  (7/15/2008).  2008 Ky. Acts ch. 81, sec. 2, provides that the amendments to this section in 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 81, sec. 1, apply to assessments made on or after January 1, 2009. (6/20/2005).  2005 Ky. Acts ch. 25, sec. 2, provides that the amendments to subsection (22) of this section shall apply for tax assessment dates on or after January 1, 2002. (3/18/2005).  2005 Ky. Acts ch. 168, sec. 171, provides that: "Sections 55 (KRS 132.020) and 57 (KRS 132.200) of this Act, relating to property tax changes, take effect on January 1, 2006, except the changes made to paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of Section 55, relating to the voluntary environmental remediation credit, paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of Section 55, and paragraph (a) of subsection (4) of Section 55 of this Act, relating to new property and the state property assessment, and subsection (21) of Section 57 of this Act, which shall take effect on the effective date of this Act and which shall apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2005." (6/21/2001).  Under KRS 446.280, the words "or leased to" have been restored to subsection (1) of this statute after the words "owned by." The phrase was added to subsection (1) by 1986 Ky. Acts ch. 359, sec. 2, but was inadvertently omitted from the drafting database. Because of this, several subsequent acts amending this statute failed to include the phrase, and it mistakenly was not included in some codifications of this statute, although it had not been deleted by legislative action using the requisite brackets and strikethrough.  (7/13/90).  The two Acts amending this section prevail over the repeal and reenactment in House Bill 940, Acts ch. 476, pursuant to Section 653(1) of Acts ch. 476. The amending Acts do not appear to be in conflict and have been compiled together. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:00</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=43463</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

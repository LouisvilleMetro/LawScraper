Acts chs. 28 and 85, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.  (4/22/2006).  2006 Ky. Acts ch. 233, sec. 1, made reference to "Department of Transportation" as shown in subsection (2)(d) of this statute. After consulting the drafter of that Act, to avoid confusion with the State Transportation Cabinet, in codification the Reviser of Statutes has changed the reference to read "U.S. Department of Transportation." </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:15</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=14475</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

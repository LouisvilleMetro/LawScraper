No delinquency shall be deemed to exist as to any asserted tax liability which is the subject of a bona fide dispute. If any delinquency be found to exist, the commissioner of revenue shall, within three (3) working days after this receipt of the certificate, furnish the details thereof to the secretary of finance and administration; and if no advice of tax delinquency is received by the secretary of finance and administration before the end of the fourth working day after his receipt of certification from the administrator, he shall, for the purposes of KRS 40.410 to 40.560, conclusively presume that no delinquency of tax liability to the Commonwealth exists, but such presumption shall apply only to the existence or absence of a set-off by the Commonwealth against a certified claim for a bonus, and shall not alter the facts as between the Commonwealth and any taxpayer. </section><section prefix="b">If no advice of tax delinquency is received within such allowed time, the secretary of finance and administration may approve payment in accordance with the certificate of the administrator, and may immediately draw a warrant on the State Treasury for a check in payment, except that no warrant shall be drawn by the secretary until sufficient funds have become available to pay the bonus authorized by KRS 40.410 to 40.560. </section><section prefix="c">Upon receipt of such warrant the State Treasurer shall issue a check in accordance therewith payable from funds made available for payment of the bonus authorized by KRS 40.410 to 40.560, and the same shall promptly be mailed to the payee thereof at the address shown in the certificate. </section></section><section prefix="2">If the secretary of finance and administration shall, within the allowed time, receive advice from the commissioner of revenue of the existence of a delinquency on the part of any person having an approved claim for a bonus, as to any tax liability to the Commonwealth, the secretary of finance and administration shall note the same on the certificate of the administrator, withhold payment, and forthwith send to the claimant by registered mail a notice of the asserted delinquency, and the amount thereof, and that it is proposed that the same be set off against the bonus payment. <section prefix="a">If the secretary of finance and administration receives no protest in his office within ten (10) working days after recording such notice, he shall conclusively presume that the proposed set-off is just, shall apply the amount thereof in reduction or extinguishment of the payment certified by the administrator, and shall advise the commissioner of revenue of the amount set off against the bonus, which advice shall be noted by the commissioner of revenue on the records of his office as a credit upon the delinquent tax liability. </section><section prefix="b">If the tax set-off does not consume the entire amount of the bonus as certified by the administrator, the secretary shall draw a warrant upon the State Treasury for a check in the amount of the remainder, and upon receiving such check from the State Treasurer, shall send the same, together with advice of the set-off, by mail, to the payee at the address shown in the certificate of the director. </section></section><section prefix="3">If the secretary of finance and administration receives from the claimant a protest of the asserted tax delinquency, within the allowed time, the secretary shall withhold approval for payment, and shall refer the protest to the commissioner of revenue for disposition. </section><section prefix="4">If a tax set-off is made, and the claimant shall assert error with regard thereto, the exclusive remedy shall be by seeking refund from the commissioner of revenue. </section></text><history> Amended 2005 Ky.

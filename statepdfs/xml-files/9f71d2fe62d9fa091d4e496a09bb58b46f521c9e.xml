A licensee that is short of facilities may store at another establishment provided that establishment is located in the State of Kentucky and is also licensed and the amount of grain stored is covered in the bond set forth in KRS 251.451. A licensee that is short of facilities and/or grain may cover shortage by giving additional bond on 100% value of grain or depositing value of grain in a special account made jointly to the Kentucky State Board of Agriculture and the licensee. This money can only be released to buy the grain from the producers or replace the grain for the producer. All interest drawn on this account is payable to the licensee after his obligations are met. </text><history>Amended 1984 Ky. Acts ch. 389, sec. 18, effective July 13, 1984. -- Amended 1972 Ky.

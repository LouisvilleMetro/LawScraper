Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent.  If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the testator's remarriage to the former spouse. </text><history>Amended 1990 Ky.

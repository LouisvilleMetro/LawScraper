If the board of trustees establishes a trust fund under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115, the board may deposit the employer contribution dedicated to retiree health in that trust fund. </section><section prefix="2">In addition to the required contributions in subsection (1) of this section, the state shall contribute annually to the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System a percentage of the total salaries of the state-funded and federally funded members it employs to pay the cost of health insurance coverage for retirees who are not eligible for Medicare and who retire on or after July 1, 2010, less the amounts that are otherwise required to be paid by the retirees under KRS 161.675. The Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System may also request an additional amount necessary to ensure payment of medical insurance costs through fiscal year 2015-2016 which shall not be subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this subsection.

In amending this section, 1990 House Bill 653, Acts ch. 442, sec. 11, did not underline the year "1990" which was intended to be added after "July 1," at the beginning of the section. As directed by KRS 446.270, the Reviser of Statutes has deleted this material from the text of this statute. Section 20 of Acts ch. 442 provides, however, that "the provisions of this Act shall become effective July 1, 1990."  (7/13/90).  The Act amending this section prevails over the repeal and reenactment in House Bill 940, Acts ch. 476, pursuant to sec. 653(1) of Acts ch. 476. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:51</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=3941</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

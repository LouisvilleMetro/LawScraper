Failure to satisfy a nonsubstantive requirement, such as using paper or envelopes of a specified size or weight, does not invalidate a document submitted under this chapter. In a write-in ballot authorized by this chapter or in a vote for a write-in candidate on a regular ballot, if the intention of the voter is discernible under the Commonwealth of Kentuckyâ€™s uniform definition of what constitutes a vote, an abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be accepted as a valid vote. </section><section prefix="2">Notarization is not required for the execution of a document under this chapter. An authentication, other than the declaration specified in KRS 117A.120 or the declaration on the federal postcard application and federal write-in absentee ballot, is not required for execution of a document under this chapter. The declaration and any information in the declaration may be compared with information on file to ascertain the validity of the document. </section></text><history> Created 2013 Ky.

When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person. The principles stated in KRS 355.3-110 apply to special indorsements. </section><section prefix="2">If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a "blank indorsement." When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed. </section><section prefix="3">The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable. </section><section prefix="4">"Anomalous indorsement" means an indorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument.

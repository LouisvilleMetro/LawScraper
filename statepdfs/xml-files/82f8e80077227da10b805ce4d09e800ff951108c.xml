The credit rate shall be one dollar ($1) per biodiesel gallon produced by a biodiesel producer, one dollar ($1) per gallon of biodiesel used in the blending process by a biodiesel blender, and one dollar ($1) per gallon of renewable diesel produced by a renewable diesel producer, unless the total amount of approved credit for all biodiesel producers, biodiesel blenders, and renewable diesel producers exceeds the annual biodiesel and renewable diesel tax credit cap. If the total amount of approved credit for all biodiesel producers, biodiesel blenders, and renewable diesel producers exceeds the annual biodiesel and renewable diesel tax credit cap, the department shall determine the amount of credit each biodiesel producer, biodiesel blender, and renewable diesel producer receives by multiplying the annual biodiesel and renewable diesel tax credit cap by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of approved credit for the biodiesel producer, biodiesel blender, and renewable diesel producer and the denominator of which is the total approved credit for all biodiesel producers, biodiesel blenders, and renewable diesel producers. </section><section prefix="b">The credit allowed under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be applied both to the income tax imposed under KRS 141.020 or 141.040 and to the limited liability entity tax imposed under KRS 141.0401, with the ordering of credits as provided in KRS 141.0205. </section></section><section prefix="2">Re-blending of blended biodiesel shall not qualify for the credit provided under this section. </section><section prefix="3">The credit shall not be carried forward to a return for any other period. </section><section prefix="4">Each biodiesel producer, biodiesel blender, and renewable diesel producer eligible for the credit provided under subsection (1) of this section shall file a tax credit claim for biodiesel gallons produced or blended in this state or for renewable diesel produced in this state on forms prescribed by the department by the fifteenth day of the first month following the close of the preceding calendar year.

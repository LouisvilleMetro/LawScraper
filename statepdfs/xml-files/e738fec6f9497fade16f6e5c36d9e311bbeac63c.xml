However, to the extent that a variable annuity contract provides benefits that do not, before the maturity date, vary in accordance with the investment performance of any separate account or accounts maintained by the insurer as to such contract, as provided for in KRS 304.15-390, the contract shall contain provisions that satisfy the requirements of this section and shall not otherwise be subject to this section. </section><section prefix="3">In the case of contracts issued on or after July 1, 2006, no contract of annuity, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract: <section prefix="a">That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, or upon the written request of the contract owner, the insurer shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections (8), (9), (10), (11), and (13) of this section; </section><section prefix="b">If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the insurer shall pay, in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit, a cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in subsections (8), (9), (10), (11), and (13) of this section. The insurer may reserve the right to defer the payment of this cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed six (6) months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract after making written request and receiving written approval of the commissioner. The request shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral; </section><section prefix="c">A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits; and </section><section prefix="d">A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which these benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract, any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract. </section></section> Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two (2) full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to that period would be less than twenty dollars ($20) monthly, the insurer may at its option terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then-present value of such portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by this payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract. <section prefix="4">The minimum values as specified in subsections (8), (9), (10), (11), and (13) of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section. <section prefix="a">The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (5) of this section of the net considerations, as defined in paragraph (b) of this subsection, paid prior to that time, decreased by the sum of: <section prefix="1">Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest as indicated in subsection (5) of this section; </section><section prefix="2">An annual contract charge of fifty dollars ($50) accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (5) of this section; and </section><section prefix="3">The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued. </section></section><section prefix="b">The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to eighty-seven and one-half percent (87.5%) of gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year. </section></section><section prefix="5">The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent (3%) per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset: <section prefix="a">The five (5) year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date or average over a period rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent (0.05%), specified in the contract no longer than fifteen (15) months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under paragraph (d) of this subsection; </section><section prefix="b">Reduced by one hundred twenty-five (125) basis points; </section><section prefix="c">Where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent (1%); and </section><section prefix="d">The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five (5) year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date. </section></section><section prefix="6">During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subsection (5)(b) of this section up to an additional one hundred (100) basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date and at each redetermination date thereafter of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The commissioner may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Lacking such demonstration that is acceptable to the commissioner, the commissioner may disallow or limit the additional reduction. </section><section prefix="7">The commissioner may promulgate administrative regulations in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A implementing the provisions of subsection (6) of this section and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts for which the commissioner determines adjustments are justified. </section><section prefix="8">Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. This present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rates specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract. </section><section prefix="9">For contracts which provide cash surrender benefits, the cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, the present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent (1%) higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine the maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under the contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit. </section><section prefix="10">For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, the present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine the maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the present values shall be calculated on the basis of the interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, in no event shall the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. </section><section prefix="11">For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections (9) and (10) of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later. </section><section prefix="12">Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided. </section><section prefix="13">Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs. </section><section prefix="14">For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (8), (9), (10), (11), and (13) of this section, additional benefits payable: <section prefix="a">In the event of total and permanent disability; </section><section prefix="b">As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; or </section><section prefix="c">As other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits; </section></section> shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of these additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless these additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits. <section prefix="15"><section prefix="a">After August 1, 2005, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to apply the provisions of this section on a contract-form by contract-form basis to annuity contracts issued by the insurer during the period from the date of the election through June 30, 2006. </section><section prefix="b">Insurers shall apply the provisions of this section to annuity contracts issued on or after July 1, 2006. </section></section></text><history> Amended 2010 Ky.

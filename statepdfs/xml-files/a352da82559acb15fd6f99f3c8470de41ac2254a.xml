Acts ch. 158, sec. 2, directed that this section be created as a new section of KRS Chapter 40, the statute has been codified in KRS Chapter 36 because, given the subject matter of the section, this is the more logical placement. See KRS 7.136(1)(a). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:25</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=21446</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

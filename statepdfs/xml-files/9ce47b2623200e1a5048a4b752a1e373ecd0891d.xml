Acts ch. 178, sec. 14, effective July 15, 2008. </history><metadata><effective> June 8, 2011 </effective><lrc-note> (6/8/2011).  2011 Ky. Acts. ch. 62, sec. 8, provides that "the provisions of Section 7 of this Act (KRS 154.30-010) shall apply retroactively and any agreements entered into prior to the effective date of this Act, for projects approved under KRS 154.30-050(2)(a) that have not been activated as of the effective date of this Act, shall be amended to reflect the revised activation date provided for in Section 7 of this Act." (6/26/2009).  2009 (1st Extra. Sess.) Ky. Acts ch. 1, sec. 103, provided that, notwithstanding KRS 65.7044(6), the amendments made to this statute in 2009 (1st Extra. Sess.) Ky. Acts ch. 1, sec. 102, "shall apply retroactively and any agreements entered into prior to the effective date of this Act for projects approved under KRS 154.30-050(2)(a) that have not been activated as of the effective date of this Act shall be amended to reflect the revised activation date provided for in Section 102 of this Act."  (7/15/2008).  2008 Ky. Acts ch. 178, sec. 14 established a new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 concerning tax increment financing projects and provided further that "KRS 65.7045 is repealed, reenacted, and amended as a new section thereof to read as follows." Since KRS 65.7045 was also amended in sec. 2 of that Act, inquiry was made of the drafter as to the intent of sec. 14. The drafter explained that statutes dealing with both area development projects and tax increment financing projects were blended together in KRS Chapter 65 with no easy distinguishing elements, and the intent of creating Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 was to separate them appropriately. The intent of sec. 14 was to create a definitions section for the new Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154, using the text of KRS 65.7045 as a base starting point, removing definitions specific to KRS Chapter 65 area development projects, retaining definitions that were common to both area development projects and tax increment financing projects, and adding definitions specific to tax increment financing projects. As such, the Reviser of Statutes has treated sec. 14 in codification as creating a new section of Subchapter 30 of KRS Chapter 154 (this statute) to effectuate that intent. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-03</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:54</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39761</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

It is at the same time recognized that under a free government it is both necessary and desirable that all citizens should have certain specific interests in the decisions of government, and that the activities and conduct of public officers and employees should not be unduly circumscribed. </text><history>Amended and reenacted as KRS 45A.330, 1978 Ky.

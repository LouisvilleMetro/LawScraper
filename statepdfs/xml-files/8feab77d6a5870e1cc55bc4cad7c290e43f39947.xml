Periodic payments may be ordered paid over a period of time not exceeding ten (10) years. Any periodic payment, upon becoming due under the terms of the judgment, shall constitute a separate judgment. Any judgment ordering any such payments shall specify the total amount awarded, the amount of each payment, the interval between payments and the number of payments to be paid under the judgment. Judgments paid pursuant to this section shall bear interest accruing from the date final judgment is entered, at the interest rate as specified in KRS 360.040. For good cause shown, the court may modify such judgment with respect to the amount of such payments and the number of payments, but the total amount of damages awarded by such judgment shall not be subject to modification in any event and periodic payments shall not be ordered paid over a period in excess of ten (10) years. </section><section prefix="2">A court may order periodic payment only upon finding that: <section prefix="a">Payment of the judgment is not totally covered by insurance; and </section><section prefix="b">Funds for the current budget year and other funds of the local government which lawfully may be utilized to pay judgments are insufficient to finance both the adopted budget of expenditures for the year and the payment of that portion of the judgment not covered by insurance. </section></section></text><history>Created 1988 Ky.

This statute refers to "the board," although under KRS 76.315 the governing body of a sewer construction district is a commission. The context in which this statute was enacted suggests that a reference to such a commission, rather than to a board, was intended. The statute was created as part of a series of sections in a bill (Sections 29 to 31 of 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 40), each of which read, "The board shall comply with the provisions of Sections 1 to 9 of this Act." In the other sections in this series, the phrase "the board" refers to the governing body of a special purpose governmental entity. It appears that a similar reference was intended to appear in this statute. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:13</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=41711</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

Acts ch. 132, sec. 5, effective July 15, 2014. </history><metadata><effective> July 15, 2014 </effective><lrc-note> (7/15/14). In subsection (3)(d)3. of this statute, the Reviser of Statutes has changed the words "paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection" to read "subparagraphs 1. and 2. of this paragraph." In an early version of the bill that created this statute (2014 Ky. Acts ch. 132, sec. 5), the phrase "paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection" was used in reference to language corresponding to the present subparagraphs 1. and 2. When the bill was redrafted before its final passage, the numbering of the paragraphs was changed, but the reference was inadvertently left unchanged. The Reviser of Statutes has made this correction under the authority of KRS 7.136(1). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:29</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=43483</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

Such taxes shall be solely for the benefit and purposes of the authority and shall be in addition to all other taxes. The legislative body may levy the ad valorem tax so requested initially and from year to year thereafter if required in conjunction with other revenues, to amortize any bonds issued or proposed for a project not disapproved under the authority of this chapter. </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

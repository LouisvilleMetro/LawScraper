Acts ch. 24, sec. 66, effective July 15, 2010. -- Created 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 101, sec. 5, effective July 13, 2004. </history><metadata><effective> July 15, 2010 </effective><lrc-note> (7/13/2004).  Under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h), during codification a manifest clerical or typographical error occurring in Ky. Acts ch. 101, sec. 5(5), has been corrected. The second clause of Ky. Acts ch. 101, sec. 5(5), reads, "provided, however, that collective bargaining agreement shall bar an election upon the petition of persons not parties thereto where more than four (4) years have elapsed...." It is clear from the context and legislative history of the Act that the word "no" was erroneously omitted before the word "collective" in the provision, and the omitted word has been restored during codification. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:15</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=24044</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

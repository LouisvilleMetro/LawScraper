If local assets are not sufficient to pay all claims allowed in this state in the amount to which they are entitled, local assets shall be marshaled so that each claim allowed in this state is paid its proportion as far as possible, after taking into account all payments on claims allowed in this state from assets in other jurisdictions. </section></text><history>Created 1988 Ky.

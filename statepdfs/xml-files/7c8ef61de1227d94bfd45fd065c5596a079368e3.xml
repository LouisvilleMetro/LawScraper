Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, both effective 7/15/2010. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together. Effective 1/1/2011, this section was also repealed and reenacted by the omnibus Kentucky Business Entity Act, 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-09-17</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:21</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=36653</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

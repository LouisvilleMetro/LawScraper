Whenever any county judge/executive shall enter an order that such security shall be furnished for all nonresident children boarded or lodged in his county, no child shall thereafter be accepted for boarding or lodging in said county until such security is furnished. Any person who accepts a nonresident child under the age of sixteen (16) years for boarding or lodging, in any county, without the furnishing of the security provided for herein, after the county judge/executive of the county has provided by order for the furnishing of such security, shall be guilty of an offense and punished as provided in subsection (3) of KRS 199.990. </text><history>Amended 1970 Ky.

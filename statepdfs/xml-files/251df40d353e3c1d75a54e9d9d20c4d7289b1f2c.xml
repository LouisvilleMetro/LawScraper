Bonds may be issued under the provisions of KRS 58.500 to 58.590 without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any proceedings or any other conditions or things, except as specifically required by KRS 58.500 to 58.590.  The provisions of KRS 58.500 to 58.590 will supersede KRS 56.450 in regard to the sale of revenue bonds by this authority.

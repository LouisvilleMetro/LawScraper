A person shall not be indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any matter in such action, suit, or proceeding as to which he or she shall finally be adjudged to be or have been guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society nor in relation to any matter in such action, suit, or proceeding, or threat thereof, which has been made the subject of a compromise settlement, unless in either case the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the society and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The determination whether the conduct of the person met the standard required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement in relation to any matter described in the preceding sentence may only be made by the supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, as to the person shall not create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement. The foregoing right of indemnification and reimbursement shall not be exclusive of other rights to which the person may be entitled as a matter of law and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, and administrators. </section><section prefix="3">A society may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee, or agent of any other firm, corporation, or organization against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the society would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under this section. </section></text><history>Created 1988 Ky.

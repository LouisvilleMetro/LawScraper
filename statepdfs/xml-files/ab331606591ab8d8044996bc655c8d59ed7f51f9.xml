The registration receipt issued by the county clerk shall be stamped across its face with a notation prescribed by the cabinet that will indicate the registration receipt so issued cannot be used in transferring legal title to the motor vehicle. However, under regulations prescribed by the cabinet, a registration receipt so issued may be transferred to a new owner if the foreign legal title and registration is transferred in that state to the new owner. Nothing contained in this section shall release the owner of the vehicle from any tax fees or other requirements imposed by law. </text><history>Amended 1968 Ky.

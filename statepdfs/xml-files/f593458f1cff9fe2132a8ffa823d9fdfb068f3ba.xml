Acts ch. 35, sec. 1. </history><metadata><effective> June 24, 2015 </effective><lrc-note>(6/24/2015). This statute was amended by 2015 Ky. Acts chs. 4 and 47, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.  (4/10/2014).  2014 Ky. Acts ch. 102, sec. 39 provides that the amendments to this statute made in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 102, sec. 7, shall apply retroactively beginning September 1, 2011.  (7/14/2000).  In codifying the 2000 Regular Session changes to this statute, an existing reference to "subsection (2)" has been changed to "subsection (3)" under KRS 7.136(1). 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 438, sec. 5, broke down the prior subsection (2) into subsections (2) and (3), and the reference to fiscal year remained in the resulting subsection (3), but the necessary adjustment to the reference in subsection (1) was inadvertently overlooked.  (7/14/92).  This section was amended by two 1992 Acts. Where those Acts are not in conflict, they have been compiled together. Where a conflict exists, the Act which was last enacted by the General Assembly prevails, pursuant to KRS 446.250. </lrc-note><budget-ref> See State/Executive Branch Budget, 2014 Ky.

This option shall be available only during the entitlement period described under KRS 161.661(3) and (4) prior to the recalculation of the member's disability allowance under KRS 161.661(5). In selecting this right, the spouse shall be limited to selecting an option providing a straight life annuity with refundable balance or a term certain option. There shall be a monthly minimum allowance of three hundred dollars ($300) as the basic straight life annuity. This section applies to surviving spouses of members who were receiving benefit payments under KRS 161.520 as of June 30, 1988, and to surviving spouses of members who die on or after July 1, 1984, except that the member shall have been retired for disability with a minimum of thirty (30) years of service if either of these two (2) conditions were met prior to July 1, 1990. </text><history> Amended 2008 Ky.

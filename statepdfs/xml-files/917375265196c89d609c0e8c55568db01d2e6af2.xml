In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within one (1) year before the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord's conduct was in retaliation. The presumption does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of a proposed rent increase or diminution of services. "Presumption" means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence. </section><section prefix="3">Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, a landlord may bring an action for possession if: <section prefix="a">The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in his household or upon the premises with his consent; </section><section prefix="b">The tenant is in default in rent; or </section><section prefix="c">Compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit. </section></section><section prefix="4">The maintenance of an action under subsection (3) of this section does not release the landlord from liability under KRS 383.625(2). </section></text><history>Repealed and reenacted 1984 Ky.

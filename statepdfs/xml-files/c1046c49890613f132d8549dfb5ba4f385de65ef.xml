The cabinet shall not initiate negotiation for operation or maintenance of a waterway under federal control unless the lack of an agreement jeopardizes the continued navigation of said waterway. Any agreement negotiated by the cabinet shall be subject to the approval of the Governor and the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet, and, if the negotiated agreement will involve the expenditure of state funds, the General Assembly may appropriate funds to fulfill the terms of the negotiated agreement before the negotiated agreement shall become effective. </text><history>Created 1982 Ky.

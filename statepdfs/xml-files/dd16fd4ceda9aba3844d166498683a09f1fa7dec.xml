Acts ch. 158, sec. 84, instructs the Reviser of Statutes to correct statutory references to agencies and officers affected by the Act, as it confirms the reorganization of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services within the executive branch, including the transfer of the Governorâ€™s Council on Wellness and Physical Activity from the Office of the Governor to the Department for Public Health. Such a correction has been made in this statute. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:13</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=41812</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

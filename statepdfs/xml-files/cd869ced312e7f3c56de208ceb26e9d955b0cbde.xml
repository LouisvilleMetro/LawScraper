See 1990 Ky. Acts ch. 370, sec. 2. The 1992 amendment to this statute, however, did not include this language. See 1992 Ky. Acts ch. 450, sec. 1. This erroneous omission has been corrected by restoring the language in question as required by KRS 446.280. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-03</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:32</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=44024</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

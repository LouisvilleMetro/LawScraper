Where the owner is not the operator of the vessel or motorboat he shall not be liable for such injury or damage unless such owner is aboard the vessel or motorboat at the time of such injury or damage or unless the operator at such time of injury or damage is operating said boat upon the owner's business or in the course and scope of his employment with the owner. The "Family Purpose Doctrine" as it is applied in the use and operation of automobiles shall be applicable to the use and operation of vessels or motorboats. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to relieve any other person from any liability which he would otherwise have, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize or permit any recovery in excess of injury or damage actually incurred. </text><history>Created 1960 Ky.

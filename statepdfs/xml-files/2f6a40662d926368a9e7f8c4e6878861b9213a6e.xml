The Reviser of Statutes has renumbered the subparagraphs of subsection (3)(a) of this statute and deleted the word "which" under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a) and (h). (6/20/2005).  2005 Ky. Acts ch. 97, sec. 2, amends this section to insert a reference to "KRS 18A.115(g) and (h)" in subsection (4). Because only subsection (1) of KRS 18A.115 contains paragraphs (g) and (h), and those paragraphs relate to principal assistants exempted from classified service, the reference has been changed in codification to "KRS 18A.115(1)(g) and (h)" under KRS 7.136(1)(e) and (h). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:26</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=40097</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

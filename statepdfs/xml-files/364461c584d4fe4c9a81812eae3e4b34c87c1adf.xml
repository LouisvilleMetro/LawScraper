The bonds shall be payable solely from the revenue derived from the operation of the hospital as provided in KRS 216.160, and shall not constitute an indebtedness of the city within the meaning of the constitution. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond that it was issued under the provisions of KRS 216.100 to 216.220 and does not constitute an indebtedness of the city within the meaning of the Constitution. </text><history> Amended 1996 Ky.

The reference to KRS 77.115(3) in subsection (2) of this statute appeared in 2000 Ky. Acts ch. 136, sec. 3, as "subsection (1) of Section 3 of this Act." The drafter's version had this reference as "Section 1(3) of this Act," but this was inadvertently transposed in the review process to "subsection (1) of Section 3 of this Act." It is manifestly clear from the text of Acts Chapter 136 that the reference intended was to "subsection (3) of Section 1" of the Act, which the drafter's version confirms. For that reason, under KRS 7.136(1)(h), the reference has been codified as "KRS 77.115(3)" rather than as "subsection (3) of this section." </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:34</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=10354</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

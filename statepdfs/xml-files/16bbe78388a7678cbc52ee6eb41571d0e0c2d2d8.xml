If the court finds that no tax bill was delinquent when the suit was instituted or tried then the judgment of the court shall be that the cause be dismissed as to the parcels of real estate described in the tax bill.  If the evidence warrants, the judgment may be for the principal amount of the delinquent tax bill upon the real estate upon which the suit was brought, together with interest, penalties, and court costs computed as of the date of the judgment.  The court may decree that the lien upon the parcel of real estate described in the tax bill be enforced and such real estate be sold by the master commissioner and the cost continued for further proceedings as provided by KRS 91.484 to 91.527. </text><history>Amended 1982 Ky.

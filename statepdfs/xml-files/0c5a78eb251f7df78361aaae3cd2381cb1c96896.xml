Acts ch. 65, sec. 15, effective July 13, 2004. </history><metadata><effective> July 13, 2004 </effective><lrc-note> (7/13/2004). When this statute was enacted (2004 Ky. Acts ch. 65, sec. 15), the word "subchapter" was erroneously included in the last sentence of the section. KRS Chapter 349, which was created in this bill, is not divided into subchapters. This manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected by changing the word "subchapter" to "chapter" by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to KRS 7.136. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:46</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=32738</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

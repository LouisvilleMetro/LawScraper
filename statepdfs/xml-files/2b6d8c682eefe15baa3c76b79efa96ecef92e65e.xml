If gas is found between two (2) workable beds of coal, in a hole of the same diameter from bed to bed, two (2) packers shall be placed with perforations in the casing between them, permitting the gas to pass inside the adjacent casing to the surface. The strings of casing shall in either case extend from their seats to the top of the well.  </text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky. Acts ch. 208, sec. 1, effective October 1, 1942, from Ky.

The court shall then issue a warrant, directed to the sheriff or any constable or town marshal of the county, authorizing him to levy upon and seize the cattle for the amount due, with interest and costs. If the cattle are removed with the consent and from the custody of the livery stable keeper or the person feeding or grazing them, the lien shall not continue longer than one <section prefix="1">year from and after the removal, nor shall the lien in case of such removal be valid </section>against a bona fide purchaser without notice at any time after the removal. The warrant may be issued to a county other than that in which the cattle were fed or grazed, and the lien may also be enforced by action as in the case of other liens. </text><history>Amended 1984 Ky.

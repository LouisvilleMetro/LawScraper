The commissioner of financial institutions may, whenever he may deem it necessary or expedient, examine every fiduciary investment company contemplated by KRS 386.510 to 386.590 having an investment adviser which is not a national bank. In every such examination, the commissioner of financial institutions shall make inquiry as to its financial condition, the policies of its management, whether it is complying with the laws of Kentucky, and such other matters as the commissioner of financial institutions may reasonably prescribe. In the enforcement of KRS 386.510 to 386.590 and the restrictions and limitations imposed by their articles of incorporation and bylaws, the commissioner of financial institutions shall have the same powers and authority with respect to fiduciary investment companies having investment advisers other than a national bank as are conferred upon him by the laws of this state with respect to state banks and trust companies to the same extent and in the same manner as if fiduciary investment companies were expressly named in Subtitle 3 of Chapter 286 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes. </text><history> Amended 2010 Ky.

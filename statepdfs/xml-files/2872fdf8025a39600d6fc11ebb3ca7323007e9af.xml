Allen, Kentucky, 360 S.W.2d 139 (1962). Thus the maximum permissible compensation effective for the entire year of 1977 and subsequent years will be the actual compensation to be paid said officials. The year of adjustment will be the particular full calendar year involved. </section><section prefix="3">It is the intention of the Legislature that the constitutionally permissible adjustment of salaries of these officials be framed around equating current salaries with the purchasing power of the dollar in 1949 when Section 246 of the Constitution of Kentucky was amended. Section 246 of the Constitution of Kentucky, as amended, established a monetary level of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) per annum for said officials. The formula merely effects an adjustment of the constitutional monetary level in terms of the current consumer price index. </section><section prefix="4">In order to adjust the compensation of the Governor to reflect changes in the purchasing power of the dollar, the Department for Local Government shall compute by the second Friday in February of every year, beginning in 1985, an adjusted salary of the Governor by multiplying sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) by the increase in the consumer price index during the period from January 1, 1984, to the beginning of the then-current calendar year. The actual compensation paid to the Governor for the entire calendar year of 1985 and subsequent years shall be the adjusted salary. </section></text><history> Amended 2010 Ky.

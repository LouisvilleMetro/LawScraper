The court may order payments to be made to the mother or to some person, corporation, or agency designated to administer them under the supervision of the court. Willful failure of the alleged father to perform the judgment of the court may be punished as a contempt of the court. The court may impose a punishment of not more than thirty (30) days imprisonment in the county jail without the intervention of a jury.

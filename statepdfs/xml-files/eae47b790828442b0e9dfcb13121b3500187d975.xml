Acts ch. 96, sec. 20, effective June 26, 2007. -- Created 1992 Ky. Acts ch. 299, sec. 7, effective July 14, 1992. </history><metadata><effective> June 26, 2007 </effective><lrc-note> (7/14/92).  This statute was created in 1992 Ky. Acts ch. 299, which contains the enrolled text of Senate Bill 250. A committee substitute for this bill was adopted by the House with a floor amendment, and the Senate subsequently concurred in this action by the House; this amended substitute thus became the enrolled version of the bill. In drafting the House Committee Substitute, the original Section 10 of the bill was deleted in its entirety, but internal section references within the bill were not renumbered to reflect this deletion. Therefore, in codifying this statute, the internal section references within Acts ch. 299, sec. 7, have been changed pursuant to KRS 7.136(1). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:53</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=31413</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

Acts ch. 348, secs. 1 and 2 were enacted to be placed within the range of KRS 18A.228 to 18A.2284. However, because of space limitations within this range, these two sections were codified as KRS 18A.2285 and 18A.2286, respectively. Accordingly, the prior reference within this section to the former end section of the range has been changed by the Reviser of Statutes to read KRS 18A.2286, pursuant to his authority under KRS 7.136. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-01</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:27</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=1410</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

But the officer may leave it, subject to the lien of the levy, with the person in whose possession it was found, pending the proceeding on the bond; and may, in the meantime, proceed with the execution against any other property of the defendant. The obligor in such bond may, however, on ten (10) days' notice to the plaintiff in the execution, move the court to which the bond is returned to discharge the same and release the levy under the execution. The provisions of KRS 426.655 and 426.660 shall, so far as applicable, govern the proceedings upon such motion. </text><history>Transferred 1952 Ky.

Historically these burial services have been conducted by the active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, the military reserves, and the veteransâ€™ service organizations. However, increasing death rates, declining military resources, and an aging membership of veteransâ€™ service organizations present the need for new initiatives in support of military burial honors. </section><section prefix="2">To correct this situation, and recognizing the immediate need, the Department of Military Affairs shall oversee a Military Burial Honor Guard Program, in coordination with the Department of Veteransâ€™ Affairs, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. </section><section prefix="3">The Department of Military Affairs, in consultation with and as a supplement to the Department of Defense, active United States military commands in Kentucky, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the military reserves, and veterans service organizations, shall implement and administer the provisions of KRS 36.390 to 36.396 through the promulgation of administrative regulations.

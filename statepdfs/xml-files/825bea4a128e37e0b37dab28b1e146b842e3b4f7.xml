The purpose of the early renewal procedures is to ensure the criminal history background check required under KRS 281A.300 may be completed prior to the expiration date on the license. A person may obtain the information necessary to conduct the criminal history background check from the circuit clerk. If the person has a law enforcement agency other than the State Police conduct the background check, the law enforcement agency may charge the person a nonrefundable fee for the service. Any fee charged by any law enforcement agency to conduct a criminal history background check shall be an amount not greater than the actual cost of processing the request and conducting the search. </text><history> Amended 2007 Ky.

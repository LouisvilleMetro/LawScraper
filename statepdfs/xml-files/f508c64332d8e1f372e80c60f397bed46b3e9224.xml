In such case it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false but only that one (1) or the other was false and not believed by the defendant to be true. </section><section prefix="2">The highest offense of which a person may be convicted in such an instance shall be determined by hypothetically assuming each statement to be false.

The commission shall thereupon set the application for formal public hearing, and shall give notice to all other water suppliers, whether publicly owned or privately owned, and whether or not regulated by the commission, rendering services in the general area proposed to be served by said water district or water association, and to any planning and zoning or other regulatory agency or agencies with authority in the general area having concern with the application. The commission may subpoena and summon for hearing purposes any persons deemed necessary by the commission in order to enable the commission to evaluate the application of the proponents of said proposed water district or water association, and reach a decision in the best interests of the general public. Intervention by any interested parties, water suppliers, municipal corporations, and governmental agencies shall be freely permitted at such hearing. </section><section prefix="2">The public hearing shall be conducted by the commission pursuant to the provisions of KRS 278.020. At the time of the hearing, no employment of counsel or of engineering services shall have been made to be paid from water district funds, water association funds, or made a charge in futuro against water district or water association funds, if formation of such water district or water association is permitted by the commission. </section><section prefix="3">Before the Public Service Commission shall approve any application for creation of a water district or water association, the commission must make a finding and determination of fact that the geographical area sought to be served by such proposed water district or water association cannot be feasibly served by any existing water supplier, whether publicly or privately owned, and whether or not subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the commission. If it shall be determined that the geographical area sought to be served by the proposed water district or water association can be served more feasibly by any other water supplier, the commission shall deny the application and shall hold such further hearings and make such further determinations as may in the circumstances be appropriate in the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare. </section><section prefix="4">Any order entered by the commission in connection with an application for creation of a water district or water association shall be appealable to the Franklin Circuit Court as provided by KRS 278.410. </section></text><history>Amended 1978 Ky.

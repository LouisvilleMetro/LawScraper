This statute refers to "the board of directors," although under KRS 108.030 the governing body of an urban services district is a council. The context in which this statute was enacted suggests that a reference to such a council, rather than to a board, was intended. The statute was created as part of a series of sections in a bill (Sections 47 to 53 of 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 40), each of which requires the governing body of a governmental entity to comply with the provisions of KRS 65A.010 to 65A.090. It appears that a similar reference was intended to appear in this statute. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:05</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=41731</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

Acts ch. 24, sec. 804, effective July 15, 2010. -- Created 2009 Ky. Acts ch. 98, sec. 23, effective June 25, 2009. </history><metadata><effective> July 15, 2010 </effective><lrc-note>(6/25/2009). 2009 Ky. Acts ch. 98, sec. 25, provided in pertinent part that "â€¦Sections 9 through 24 of this Act take effect January 1, 2010." This statute was erroneously added as the next-to-last section (Section 23) of that Act and "Sections 9 through 23" was changed to "Sections 9 through 24" in Section 25 of that Act to reflect its inclusion. However, it is clear from the language of this statute that it should have been added as the last section of the Act instead with no change being made to the delayed effective date language of Section 25. The Reviser of Statutes is treating the misplacement of this statute in that Act as a manifest clerical and typographical error correctable under KRS 7.136(1)(h). Therefore, this statute is effective June 25, 2009, not January 1, 2010. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:13</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=14906</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

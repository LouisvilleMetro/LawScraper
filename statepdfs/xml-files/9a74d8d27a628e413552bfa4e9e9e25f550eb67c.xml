The assessor guilty of the omission, and his sureties, shall be liable to the city for any damage by loss of lien. Any person retrospectively assessed may, within thirty (30) days after notice of the assessment is mailed to him, file in the assessor's office the complaint provided for in KRS 91.400, and if such a complaint is filed in time the assessment shall not become binding and no tax bill shall be issued thereon until the assessment has been passed upon by the board of equalization.  </text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky.

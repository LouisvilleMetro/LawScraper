The telephone exchange receiving any message from the exchange in which the message originated, and each other connecting exchange through which the message must be routed in order to reach its destination, shall switch the message through its exchange without unreasonable delay or discrimination and with the same promptness with which messages originating and ending on its own lines are handled, by causing the talking circuit to be connected over the toll line leading through or from the receiving exchange through any other connecting exchanges to the point of destination. It is the intention of this section to compel the connecting up and usage of toll wires through the various intervening exchanges between the exchange in which the messages originate and the point of destination, so that the party requesting service may be able to hold a conversation with the party called for at the point of destination.  </text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky.

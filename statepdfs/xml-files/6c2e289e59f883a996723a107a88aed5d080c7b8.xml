An asset-backed security that relies on collateral that meets the requirements of subparagraph 2. of this paragraph, the par value of which collateral: remaining term to maturity from the date of acquisition; sufficient to provide a yield to maturity for the investment, considering the amount prepaid and reinvestment rates at the time of early repayment, at least equal to the yield to maturity of the initial investment; or to the yield of a Treasury issue of comparable remaining life; or not prepayable at any time at par, but is not otherwise governed by subparagraph 5. of this paragraph, if the asset-backed security has a par value reflecting principal payments to be received if held until retired by or on behalf of the issuer and is purchased at a price no greater than one hundred five percent (105%) of the par amount; (b) An asset-backed security that: 1. Relies on cash flows from assets that are prepayable at par at any time; 2. Does not make payments of par that are fixed as to amount and timing; and 3. Has a negative rate of return at the time of acquisition if a prepayment threshold assumption is used with the prepayment threshold assumption defined as either: recognized, publicly available source as being the median of expectations contributed by broker dealers or other entities, except insurers, engaged in the business of selling or evaluating the securities or assets. The prepayment expectation used in this calculation shall be, at the insurer's election, the prepayment expectation for pass-through securities of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Government National Mortgage Association, or for other assets of the same type as the assets that underlie the asset-backed security, in either case with a gross weighted average coupon comparable to the gross weighted average coupon of the assets that underlie the asset-backed security; or commissioner by administrative regulation promulgated under KRS 304.7-367; or (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the asset-backed security is purchased in combination with one (1) or more other asset-backed securities that are supported by identical underlying collateral, the insurer may calculate the rate of return for these specific combined asset-backed securities in combination.

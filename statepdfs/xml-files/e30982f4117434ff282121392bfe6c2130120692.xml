The reference to "KRS 65.220 to 65.300" in subsection (4) of this section has been changed back to its original form of "KRS 65.210 to 65.300." Subsection (4) was added to this statute by 1984 Ky. Acts ch. 7, sec. 1, and contained the reference to "KRS 65.210 to 65.300." Although the amendment of the statute by 1986 Ky. Acts ch. 278, sec. 2 did not change this reference, it was altered to "KRS 65.220 to 65.300" in the codification of that Act. Because it is clear from an examination of KRS Chapter 65 that the range in question is KRS 65.210 to 65.300 and no reason is given or can be determined for altering the text as originally enacted, the original text of the reference has been restored. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:48</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=5416</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

The policy may also provide that no designation or change of beneficiary shall be binding on the insurer until indorsed on the policy by the insurer, and that the insurer may refuse to indorse the name of any proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. The policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, then the insurer may make any payment thereunder to the executor or administrator of the insured, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention or burial of the insured. The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to any other payment due under the policy.  </text><history>Created 1970 Ky.

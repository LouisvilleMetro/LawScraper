Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the commission may issue temporary bonds or certificates, exchangeable for definitive bonds when the same shall have been executed and are ready for delivery; and provision may also be made for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated, or be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of KRS 177.700 to 177.820 without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth and without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions, events or things other than the proceedings, conditions, events, and things which are specifically required by KRS 177.700 to 177.820. </text><history>Created 1960 Ky.

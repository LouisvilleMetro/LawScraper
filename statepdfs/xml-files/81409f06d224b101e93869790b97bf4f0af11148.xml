A county not certified on the basis of final unemployment figures may also be certified as a qualified county if the authority determines the county is one (1) of the sixty (60) most distressed counties in the Commonwealth based on the following criteria with equal weight given to each criterion: <section prefix="a">The average countywide rate of unemployment in the most recent three (3) consecutive calendar years, on the basis of final unemployment figures calculated by the Office of Employment and Training within the Department of Workforce Investment in the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet; </section><section prefix="b">In each county the percentage of adults twenty-five (25) years of age and older who have attained at least a high school education or equivalent, on the basis of the most recent data available from the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census; and </section><section prefix="c">Road quality, as quantified by the access within a county to roads ranked in descending order from best quality to worst quality as follows: two (2) or more interstate highways, one (1) interstate highway, a state four (4) lane parkway, four (4) lane principal arterial access to an interstate highway, state two (2) lane parkway and none of the preceding road types, as certified by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet to the authority. </section></section> If the authority determines that a county which has previously been certified as a qualified county no longer meets the criteria of this subsection, the authority shall decertify that county. The authority shall not provide inducements for any facilities in that county and an approved company shall not be eligible for the inducements offered by KRS 154.22-010 to 154.22-070 unless the tax incentive agreements required herein are entered into by all parties prior to July 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the authority decertified that county.

The General Assembly further finds that waste tires can be used in civil engineering applications, as tire-derived fuel, and may be recycled, but that markets for these uses have not been adequately developed. Therefore, a waste tire program should be established to manage waste tires in a way that protects human health, safety, and the environment, and which encourages the development of markets for waste tires. </text><history> Created 1998 Ky.

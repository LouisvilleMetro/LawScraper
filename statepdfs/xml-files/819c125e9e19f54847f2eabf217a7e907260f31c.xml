(7/12/2006).  2006 Ky. Acts ch. 78, secs. 1 to 10, amend sections in KRS 311.840 to 311.862 to replace certification requirements for physician assistants with licensure requirements. Although this section was included in the Act and most of the references in it were changed from "certification" to "licensing," one reference in subsection (6) was overlooked and has been corrected in codification by the Reviser of Statutes under KRS 7.136(1). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:57</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=30648</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

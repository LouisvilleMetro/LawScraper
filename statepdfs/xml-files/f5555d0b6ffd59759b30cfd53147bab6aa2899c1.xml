Acts ch. 102, sec. 18, amended KRS 243.884, following a free conference committee for HB 445 to "adjust the tax rates on beer and wine." In this amendment the internal numbering of KRS 243.884 was changed and subsection (2) was renumbered as subsection (3). An existing reference within KRS 243.884 to "subsection (3) of this section" was changed to "subsection (2)." However this conforming change was not made to another statute, KRS 243.882(1), which refers to "KRS 243.884(2)." The Reviser of Statutes has made this change to KRS 243.882(1) under the authority of KRS 7.136. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:30</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=11420</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

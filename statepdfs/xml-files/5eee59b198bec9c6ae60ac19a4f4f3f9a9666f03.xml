In such event, however, such corporation may thereafter continue in existence as a corporation, subject to the general corporation law. In the event that a certified copy of such order shall be so filed, all real property acquired by or for such redevelopment corporation by condemnation shall be disposed of, either alone or in conjunction with additional real property not so acquired, within a reasonable time by bona fide sale. All amounts received by the redevelopment corporation for such real property in excess of an amount equal to that portion of the development cost allocable to the real property being disposed of, shall be paid to the city. </text><history>  Created 1942 Ky.

This statute was amended by 2014 Ky. Acts chs. 89 and 92. Acts ch. 92 was passed last by the General Assembly and, ordinarily, any provisions in ch. 92 which conflict with provisions in ch. 89, the earlier-passed bill, would prevail under the authority of KRS 446.250. However, new language added in ch. 92 has not been incorporated into KRS 11.200 because to make such change would make the section unintelligible. KRS 7.136(3) provides that if a statute is amended by more than one act in the same session of the General Assembly, that the change shall be given effect and incorporated only if the change will make the section intelligible. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:26</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=43338</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

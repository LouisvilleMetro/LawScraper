An infant spouse may also be permitted by the Circuit Court to unite with his adult spouse in the conveyance of the adult spouse's real estate without terms, or on such terms as may be deemed equitable, so as to release the inchoate right of dower or curtesy of the infant spouse. If, in judicial proceedings to sell the real estate of an infant spouse, or of a spouse judicially declared mentally disabled, his spouse is made a party defendant, and by answer, and on privy examination in open court or by a judge of a court in which such proceedings are pending, or by a commissioner appointed by the court to take the case, the spouse not under disability consents to a sale of the property, free from the inchoate right of dower or curtesy of the spouse not under disability, either without terms or on terms designated by the spouse not under disability, the court may, if it deems the terms of such consent equitable, order the sale of such property, free from the inchoate right of dower or curtesy, upon the terms of consent proposed by that spouse. </text><history>Amended 1982 Ky.

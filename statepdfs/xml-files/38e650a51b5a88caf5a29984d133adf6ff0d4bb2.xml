Acts ch. 242, sec. 9 (this section) contained a reference to "Section 11 of this Act" in the last sentence of subsection (2)(ai). Section 11 of that Act repealed and reenacted KRS 355.1-203. In codification, a manifest clerical or typographical error resulted in that reference being cited as KRS 355.1-204 instead of KRS 355.1-203. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected this error under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:45</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=40645</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

(1)(f), replaced "thirty (30) contact hours" with "thirty-nine (39) contact hours," and inserted the clause that provides, "the increased requirement to be a condition for renewal of licenses beginning with renewals occurring after June 30, 2013."  (7/15/94).  This statute was amended by 1994 Ky. Acts chs. 265 and 470, which were companion bills and are substantively identical. These Acts have been codified together. For the few minor variations between the Acts, Acts ch. 470 prevails under KRS 446.250, as the Act which passed the General Assembly last.  (11/19/91, amended 7/15/94).  Pursuant to KRS 7.136(1), the Reviser of Statutes has replaced the word "suspended" in subsection (9) of this statute (1986 Acts ch. 128, sec. 6) with "suspected" to correct a manifest clerical or typographical error. (1992 Acts ch. 104, sec. 4 renumbered the former subsection (9) of this statute as subsection (1)(i); 1994 Acts ch. 470, sec. 8 renumbered subsection (1)(i) as subsection (1)(k).) </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:54</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=31224</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

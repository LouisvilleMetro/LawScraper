For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the like amount of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage." <section prefix="2">If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set out in subsection (1) of KRS 304.17-230, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase "...

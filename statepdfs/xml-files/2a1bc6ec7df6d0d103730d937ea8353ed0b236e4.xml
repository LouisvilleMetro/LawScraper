For purposes of this paragraph: <section prefix="1">Medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment is taken into account only if it is recommended by, or received from, an individual licensed or similarly authorized to provide such services under state law and operating within the scope of practice authorized by state law; and </section><section prefix="2">The six (6) month period ending on the enrollment date begins on the six (6) month anniversary date preceding the enrollment date; </section></section><section prefix="b">The exclusion extends for a period of not more than twelve (12) months, or eighteen (18) months in the case of a late enrollee, after the enrollment date; </section><section prefix="c"><section prefix="1">The period of any pre-existing condition exclusion that would otherwise apply to an individual is reduced by the number of days of creditable coverage the individual has as of the enrollment date, as counted under subsection (3) of this section; and </section><section prefix="2">Except for ineligible individuals who apply for coverage in the individual market, the period of any pre-existing condition exclusion that would otherwise apply to an individual may be reduced by the number of days of creditable coverage the individual has as of the effective date of coverage under the policy; and </section></section><section prefix="d">A written notice of the pre-existing condition exclusion is provided to participants under the plan, and the insurer cannot impose a pre-existing condition exclusion with respect to a participant or a dependent of the participant until such notice is provided. </section></section><section prefix="3">In reducing the pre-existing condition exclusion period that applies to an individual, the amount of creditable coverage is determined by counting all the days on which the individual has one (1) or more types of creditable coverage. For purposes of counting creditable coverage: <section prefix="a">If on a particular day the individual has creditable coverage from more than one (1) source, all the creditable coverage on that day is counted as one (1) day; </section><section prefix="b">Any days in a waiting period for coverage are not creditable coverage; </section><section prefix="c">Days of creditable coverage that occur before a significant break in coverage are not required to be counted; and </section><section prefix="d">Days in a waiting period and days in an affiliation period are not taken into account in determining whether a significant break in coverage has occurred. </section></section><section prefix="4">An insurer may determine the amount of creditable coverage in another manner than established in subsection (3) of this section that is at least as favorable to the individual as the method established in subsection (3) of this section. </section><section prefix="5">If an insurer receives creditable coverage information, the insurer shall make a determination regarding the amount of the individualâ€™s creditable coverage and the length of any pre-existing exclusion period that remains. A written notice of the length of the pre-existing condition exclusion period that remains after offsetting for prior creditable coverage shall be issued by the insurer. An insurer may not impose any limit on the amount of time that an individual has to present a certificate or evidence of creditable coverage. </section><section prefix="6">For purposes of this section: <section prefix="a">"Pre-existing condition exclusion" means, with respect to coverage, a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to a condition based on the fact that the condition was present before the effective date of coverage, whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before that day. A pre-existing condition exclusion includes any exclusion applicable to an individual as a result of information relating to an individualâ€™s health status before the individualâ€™s effective date of coverage under a health benefit plan; </section><section prefix="b">"Enrollment date" means, with respect to an individual covered under a group health plan or health insurance coverage, the first day of coverage or, if there is a waiting period, the first day of the waiting period. If an individual receiving benefits under a group health plan changes benefit packages, or if the employer changes its group health insurer, the individualâ€™s enrollment date does not change; </section><section prefix="c">"First day of coverage" means, in the case of an individual covered for benefits under a group health plan, the first day of coverage under the plan and, in the case of an individual covered by health insurance coverage in the individual market, the first day of coverage under the policy or contract; </section><section prefix="d">"Late enrollee" meansan individual whose enrollment in a plan is a late enrollment; </section><section prefix="e">"Late enrollment" means enrollment of an individual under a group health plan other than: <section prefix="1">On the earliest date on which coverage can become effective for the individual under the terms of the plan; or </section><section prefix="2">Through special enrollment; </section></section><section prefix="f">"Significant break in coverage" means a period of sixty-three (63) consecutive days during each of which an individual does not have any creditable coverage; and</section><section prefix="g">"Waiting period" means the period that must pass before coverage for an employee or dependent who is otherwise eligible to enroll under the terms of a group health plan can become effective. If an employee or dependent enrolls as a late enrollee or special enrollee, any period before such late or special enrollment is not a waiting period. If an individual seeks coverage in the individual market, a waiting period begins on the date the individual submits a substantially complete application for coverage and ends on: <section prefix="1">If the application results in coverage, the date coverage begins; or</section><section prefix="2">If the application does not result in coverage, the date on which the application is denied by the insurer or the date on which the offer of coverage lapses. </section></section></section><section prefix="7"><section prefix="a"><section prefix="1">Except as otherwise provided under subsection (3) of this section, for purposes of applying subsection (2)(c) of this section, a group health plan, and a health insurance insurer offering group health insurance coverage, shall count a period of creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits covered during the period. </section><section prefix="2">A group health plan, or a health insurance insurer offering group health insurance coverage, may elect to apply subsection (2)(c) of this section based on coverage of benefits within each of several classes or categories of benefits specified in federal regulations.

If a child is enrolled in a group health plan or other creditable coverage within thirty (30) days after birth and subsequently enrolls in another group health plan without a significant break in coverage, the other group health plan may not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion on the child. </section><section prefix="b">Subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, a group health plan, and a health insurance insurer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion on a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining eighteen (18) years of age and who, within thirty (30) days after the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under any creditable coverage.

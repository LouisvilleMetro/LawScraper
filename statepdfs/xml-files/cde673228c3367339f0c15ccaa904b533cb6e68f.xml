The appointment of challengers shall be certified in all respects as challengers at regular elections, except as otherwise provided in this section. The challengers shall be registered voters of the county in which the primary is held and shall be subject to the same penalties and possess the same rights and privileges as challengers at regular elections, except that the challengers of one political party shall not be entitled to challenge persons who offer to vote for candidates of any other party in the primary.

If more than one (1) committee alleging itself to advocate or oppose the same amendment file such a petition, the county board of elections shall decide, and announce by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each committee not less than the third Tuesday preceding the election, which committee is entitled to nominate the challengers.

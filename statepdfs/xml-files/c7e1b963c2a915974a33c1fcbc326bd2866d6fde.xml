Acts ch. 288, sec. 30, and ch. 463, sec. 14, which appear to be in conflict. Those changes made by ch. 463 which are purely technical to standardize penalties into Penal Code format, are revisory in nature, and the substantive changes made by ch. 288 prevail by virtue of KRS 7.123(1). Otherwise, the changes of ch. 463 control pursuant to KRS 446.250. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:04</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=27878</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

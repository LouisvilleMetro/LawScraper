KRS 141.455 to 141.475 are enacted to provide a means by which the protection of nongame species and the acquisition of land or interests in land and the protection, maintenance, and use of the land, may be financed in part through a voluntary check-off designation on state income tax return forms. </text><history>Created 1980 Ky.

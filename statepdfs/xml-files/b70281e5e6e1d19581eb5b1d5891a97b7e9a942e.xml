Such alternatives may include, but shall not be limited to, the provision of medical, educational, psychiatric, psychological, social work, counseling, day care, or homemaking services with monitoring wherever necessary by the cabinet or other appropriate agency. Where the court specifically finds that such alternatives are adequate to reasonably protect the child against the alleged dependency, neglect or abuse, the court shall not order the removal or continued removal of the child. </section><section prefix="2">If the court orders the removal or continues the removal of the child, services provided to the parent and the child shall be designed to promote the protection of the child and the return of the child safely to the child's home as soon as possible. The cabinet shall develop a treatment plan for each child designed to meet the needs of the child. The cabinet may change the child's placement or treatment plan as the cabinet may require. The cabinet shall notify the committing court of the change, in writing, within fourteen (14) days after the change has been implemented. </section></text><history> Amended 1998 Ky.

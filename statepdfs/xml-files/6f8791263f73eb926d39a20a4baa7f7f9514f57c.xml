It is further declared that the Commonwealth has an obligation to provide an equitable method whereby every insurer licensed to write personal liability insurance in Kentucky be required to meet this market demand.  It is the purpose of this article to define this obligation and provide a mandatory program to assure an adequate supply of legal professional liability insurance coverage in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. </text><history>Created 1978 Ky.

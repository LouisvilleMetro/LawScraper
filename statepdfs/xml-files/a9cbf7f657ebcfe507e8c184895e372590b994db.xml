If partnership liability results, then the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, then the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation. </section><section prefix="3">Subject to subsection (1) of this section, if a person is thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not partners, then the purported partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, then a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, then the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable. </section><section prefix="4">A person is not liable as a partner merely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority. </section><section prefix="5">A person does not continue to be liable as a partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner's dissociation from the partnership. </section><section prefix="6">Except as otherwise provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, persons who are not partners as to each other are not liable as partners to other persons. </section></text><history> Created 2006 Ky.

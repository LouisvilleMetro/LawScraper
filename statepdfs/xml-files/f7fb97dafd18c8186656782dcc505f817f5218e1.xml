The General Assembly recognizes that hospitals can be more effective if they are of sufficient scope to marshal the skills and manpower necessary to provide the advantages of modern medicine and that the development of high-speed highways makes possible accessibility to such modern hospitals permitting service to a larger geographical area. It is the intent of KRS 216.310 to 216.360 to provide for the integration of the complex functions of health and hospital care for the collective benefit of all the people within an area by providing a method to extend the geographical territory to larger regions. </text><history>Created 1968 Ky.

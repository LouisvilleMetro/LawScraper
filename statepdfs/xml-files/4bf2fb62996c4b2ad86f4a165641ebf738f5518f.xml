In 1974, the Reviser of Statutes renumbered KRS 95.885 as KRS 95.991. 1980 Ky. Acts ch. 188, sec. 83, a revisory act, mistakenly changed references in this statute from "KRS 95.851 to 95.885" to "KRS 95.851 to 95.991." Because these changes would appear to effect a substantive change in the law, they have been disregarded, and the references have been made to read "KRS 95.851 to 95.884 and KRS 95.991" under KRS 7.123(4) and 7.136(1)(a). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:09</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=26106</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

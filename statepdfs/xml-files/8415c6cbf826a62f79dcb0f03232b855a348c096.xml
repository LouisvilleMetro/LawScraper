If the contractor makes no effort to remove the obstruction within twenty-four (24) hours, the county engineer shall immediately employ necessary persons, machinery and teams, and without avoidable delay, cause the obstruction to be removed from the public road, or the bridge to be made safe. The cost of removal shall be recoverable from the contractor, as provided in KRS 179.150. But if the section of obstructed road is not under contract, the county road engineer shall immediately remove the obstructions in like manner, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the fiscal court out of the county road fund. </text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky.

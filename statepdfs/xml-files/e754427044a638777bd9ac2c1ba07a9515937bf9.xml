Under the authority of KRS 7.136, the Reviser of Statutes has changed two clearly erroneous references to "committee" in subsection (2) of this statute to "subcommittee."  (6/21/93). The name of the Capital Construction and Equipment Purchase Oversight Committee was changed to the Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee in 1988. See 1988 Ky. Acts ch. 145. That same name change has been made in this statute pursuant to KRS 7.136(2). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:19</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=22310</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

In connection with such plan of financing, such provisions may be inserted in the bonds themselves and in the mortgage deed of trust as may be necessary to protect the bondholders and to make such bonds salable with the lowest net interest cost to the issuer.  If the issuer declares its intent by ordinance or resolution to follow the provisions of this section the statutory mortgage lien provided in KRS 103.250 shall not attach and all other provisions of KRS 103.200 to 103.285, inclusive, which are necessarily inconsistent with the mortgage deed of trust shall be inapplicable to the extent of such necessary inconsistency. </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

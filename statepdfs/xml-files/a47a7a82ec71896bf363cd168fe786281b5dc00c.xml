The words "cooperative permit" in the second sentence of this section have been changed in codification by the Reviser of Statutes to "cooperator permit" under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h). 2007 Ky. Acts ch. 110, sec. 2, amended KRS 150.177 to delete references to administrative regulations regarding "cooperator permits," and 2007 Ky. Acts ch. 110, sec. 1, created this section to include language similar to the deleted language. The use of "cooperative" instead of "cooperator" was a manifest clerical or typographical error. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-01</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:58</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=1970</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

The cost of such erection and attachments shall be apportioned by the trustees against the owners of the property fronting the public ways in which the fire hydrants are erected, by any equitable mode of apportionment which the board of trustees prescribes in the resolution ordering the erection of the fire hydrants and a lien shall exist against the property against which the apportionment runs for the cost of such improvement in the amount of such apportionment and interest thereon at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The lien is enforceable by proceedings in court.

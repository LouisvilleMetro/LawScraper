The commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the member states and shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by a subsequent concurrent action of the respective legislatures of the member states in accordance with the terms of this compact. B. The commission shall consist of one (1) voting representative from each member state who shall be that stateâ€™s appointed compact commissioner and who is empowered to determine statewide policy related to matters governed by this compact. The compact commissioner shall be a policymaker within the agency that houses the stateâ€™s Prescription Monitoring Program. C. In addition to the state commissioner, the state shall appoint a non-voting advisor who shall be a representative of the state Prescription Monitoring Program.  D. In addition to the voting representatives and non-voting advisor of each member state, the commission may include persons who are not voting representatives, but who are members of interested organizations as determined by the commission. E. Each member state represented at a meeting of the commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of the member states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the commission. A representative shall not delegate a vote to another member state. In the event the compact commissioner is unable to attend a meeting of the commission, the appropriate appointing authority may delegate voting authority to another person from their state for a specified meeting.

The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of a simple majority of the compacting states, shall call additional meetings. G. The commission shall establish an executive committee, which shall include officers, members, and others as determined by the bylaws. The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the commission, with the exception of rulemaking. During periods when the commission is not in session the executive committee shall oversee the administration of the compact, including enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules, and other such duties as deemed necessary.  H. The commission shall maintain a robust committee structure for governance (i.e., policy, compliance, education, technology, etc.) and shall include specific opportunities for stakeholder input. I. The commissionâ€™s bylaws and rules shall establish conditions and procedures under which the commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The commission may exempt from disclosure information or official records that would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. J. The commission shall provide public notice of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The commission may close a meeting, or portion thereof, where it determines by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the members present that an open meeting would be likely to: 1. Relate solely to the commissionâ€™s internal personnel practices and procedures; 2. Discuss matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal and state statute; 3. Discuss trade secrets or commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential; 4. Involve accusing a person of a crime, or formally censuring a person; 5.

The commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of the views expressed and the record of a roll call vote. All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the commission.

The executive director shall serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate commission. D. The interstate commissionâ€™s executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. 1. The liability of the interstate commissionâ€™s executive director and employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such personâ€™s state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. 2. The interstate commission shall defend the executive director, its employees, and subject to the approval of the Attorney General or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person. 3.

ARTICLE IX RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION A. Rulemaking Authority - The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. Any rules promulgated by the commission shall not override the stateâ€™s authority to govern prescription drugs or each stateâ€™s Prescription Monitoring Program. B. Rulemaking Procedure - Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act," of 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission. C. Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority. ARTICLE X OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION A. Oversight 1. The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compactâ€™s purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law but, shall not override the stateâ€™s authority to govern prescription drugs or the stateâ€™s Prescription Monitoring Program. 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission. 3. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact or promulgated rules. B. Default, Technical Assistance, Suspension and Termination - If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall: 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default. 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. 3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default. 4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states. 5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination. 6. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state. 7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees. C. Dispute Resolution 1. The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states. 2. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution as appropriate. D. Enforcement 1. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact. 2. The interstate commission, may by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees. 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession. ARTICLE XI MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT A. Any state that has enacted Prescription Monitoring Program legislation through statute or regulation is eligible to become a member state of this compact. B.

The interstate commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing stateâ€™s intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof. 4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. 5.

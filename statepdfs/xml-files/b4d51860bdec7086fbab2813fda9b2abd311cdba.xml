Where there is no such record, as in the case of public property, or property owned by religious, charitable, or educational institutions, the same (except that owned by the United States government) shall be specially assessed by the proper assessing officers, and for such special assessment reasonable compensation may be made. Any such special assessment shall be subject to all procedures for equalization and judicial review as may be provided by law in connection with ordinary assessments. </text><history>Created 1974 Ky.

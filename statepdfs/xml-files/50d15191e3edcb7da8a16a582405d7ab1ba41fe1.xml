The board may, in its discretion, regardless of cause, withhold payment of a refund for a period not to exceed six (6) months after receipt of an application from a member. </section><section prefix="3">Any member who has received a refund shall be considered a new member upon subsequent reemployment if such person qualifies for membership under KRS 67A.360 to 67A.690. Any member who is reemployed after withdrawing from service and who received a refund of contributions shall, within ninety (90) days of his reemployment or prior to retirement, whichever occurs first, make a repayment to the system of the amount or amounts previously received as a refund, including interest at the rate determined by the board to be the actual rate of return on investments made by the board, but not less than three percent (3%) per annum, from the dates of the refund to the date of repayment, compounded annually.

If repayment is not made within the specified time period, the member shall have forever forfeited, waived, and relinquished the right to have reinstated to his account the credited service represented by the refunds for which repayment was not made, but shall not be precluded from purchasing service credit as provided in KRS 67A.402 if the member began participating in the fund prior to March 14, 2013. </section><section prefix="4">Any member who has received, or who is entitled to receive, a refund, but who within six (6) months of becoming entitled to receive such refund, qualifies for membership under the provisions of a fund in effect in another government adopted pursuant to law, shall have the option of paying his refund into such other fund, in which event he shall be deemed a member of such other fund and his account therein shall be credited with all contributions, including those picked up pursuant to KRS 67A.510(2), and service under his original fund. </section></text><history> Amended 2014 Ky.

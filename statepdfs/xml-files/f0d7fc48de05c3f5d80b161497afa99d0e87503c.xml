The complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged unlawful practice occurs. </section><section prefix="2">The commission or an individual designated pursuant to its administrative regulations shall determine within thirty (30) days after the complaint has been filed whether there is probable cause to believe the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice. If it is determined that there is no probable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the commission shall issue an order dismissing the complaint and shall furnish a copy of the order to the complainant, the respondent, the Attorney General, and any other public officers and persons that the commission deems proper. </section><section prefix="3">The complainant, within ten (10) days after receiving a copy of the order dismissing the complaint, may file with the commission an application for reconsideration of the order. Upon receiving a reconsideration application, the commission or an individual designated pursuant to administrative regulation shall make a new determination within ten (10) days whether there is probable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice. If it is determined that there is no probable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the commission shall issue an order dismissing the complaint and furnishing a copy of the order to the complainant, the respondent, the Attorney General, and any other public officers and persons that the commission deems proper. </section><section prefix="4">If the staff determines, after investigation, or if the commission determines after the review provided for in subsection (3) of this section that there is probable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the commission staff shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful practice by conference, conciliation, and persuasion. The terms of a conciliation agreement reached with a respondent may require him to refrain from the commission of unlawful discriminatory practices in the future and make any further provisions as may be agreed upon between the commission or its staff and the respondent. If a conciliation agreement is entered into, the commission shall issue and serve on the complainant an order stating its terms. A copy of the order shall be delivered to the respondent, the Attorney General, and any other public officers and persons that the commission deems proper. Except for the terms of the conciliation agreement, neither the commission nor any officer or employee thereof shall make public, without the written consent of the complainant and the respondent, information concerning efforts in a particular case to eliminate an unlawful practice by conference, conciliation, or persuasion whether or not there is a determination of probable cause or a conciliation agreement. </section><section prefix="5">At the expiration of one (1) year from the date of a conciliation agreement, and at other times in its reasonable discretion, the commission staff may investigate whether the terms of the agreement have been and are being complied with by the respondent. Upon a finding that the terms of the agreement are not being complied with by the respondent, the commission shall take whatever action it deems appropriate to assure compliance. </section><section prefix="6">At any time after a complaint is filed, the commission may file an action in the Circuit Court in a county in which the subject of the complaint occurs, or in a county in which a respondent resides or has his principal place of business, seeking appropriate temporary relief against the respondent, pending final determination of proceedings including an order or decree restraining him from doing or procuring any act tending to render ineffectual any order the commission may enter with respect to the complaint. The court shall have power to grant temporary relief or a restraining order as it deems just and proper. </section><section prefix="7">Nothing in this section shall apply to any discriminatory housing practice. </section></text><history> Amended 2015 Ky.

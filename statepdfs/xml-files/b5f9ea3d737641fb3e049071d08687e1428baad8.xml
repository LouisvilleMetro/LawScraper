In the event of such dispute, the authorized agent of the sewer body may make adjustment for any apparent error in mathematical computation of the bill, he may tentatively agree to any proposed plan for delayed payment, or he may refer the dispute to the sewer operator for consideration. In such event the agent of the sewer body may direct that the water service not be discontinued at that time, and he shall indorse such direction upon the water supplier's discontinuance notice. If a water supplier is directed not to discontinue service, after sending an agent to perform such duty, it shall be entitled to receive its proper fee as if the discontinuance had been made.  </text><history>Created 1958 Ky.

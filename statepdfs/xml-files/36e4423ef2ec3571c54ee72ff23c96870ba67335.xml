In the case of a prisoner otherwise sui juris, consent may be given by him personally instead of by his curator if it is acknowledged before the superintendent or keeper of the prison and the superintendent or keeper certifies that, in his opinion, the prisoner gave his consent freely. If any person not sui juris is beneficially interested, a trustee appointed under subsection (2) of KRS 395.470 to collect claims and demands shall not act until he has given bond to account for the share of that person and the bond has been approved by the District Court. </text><history>Amended 1982 Ky.

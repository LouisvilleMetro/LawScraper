Restitution shall be ordered in the full amount of the damages, unless the damages exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or twice the amount of the gain from the commission of the offense, whichever is greater, in which case the higher of these two (2) amounts shall be awarded. The court may, in lieu of ordering monetary restitution, order the defendant to make restitution by working for or on behalf of the victim. The court shall determine the number of hours of work necessary by applying the then-prevailing federal minimum wage to the total amount of monetary damage caused by or incidental to the commission of the crime. The court may, with the consent of the agency, order the defendant to work as specified in KRS 533.070.

A civil verdict shall be reduced by the amount paid under the criminal restitution order. </section></section><section prefix="4">When requiring fees for controlled substances or alcohol tests, or other fees and payments authorized by this section or other statute, except restitution, to be paid by the defendant, the court shall not order the payments to be paid through the circuit clerk. </section><section prefix="5">When a defendant is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge, he shall be given a written statement explicitly setting forth the conditions under which he is being released. </section><section prefix="6">When imposing a sentence of probation or conditional discharge, the court, in addition to conditions imposed under this section, may require as a condition of the sentence that the defendant submit to a period of imprisonment in the county jail or to a period of home incarceration at whatever time or intervals, consecutive or nonconsecutive, the court shall determine. The time actually spent in confinement or home incarceration pursuant to this provision shall not exceed twelve (12) months or the maximum term of imprisonment assessed pursuant to KRS Chapter 532, whichever is the shorter.

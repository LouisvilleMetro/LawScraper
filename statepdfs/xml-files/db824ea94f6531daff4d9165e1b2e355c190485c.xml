When it appears to the court that the parents have failed to cooperate and actively participate in said programs, the court may issue a summons for the parents of the child which shall require them to attend a hearing in which they may rebut any evidence which may allege that they have violated a court order. The court may exercise its powers of contempt in addition to any other remedy provided by law to compel obedience of the parents, guardian, or person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child to the court's orders. </text><history> Amended 1996 Ky.

The Reviser of Statutes has corrected a manifest clerical or typographical error in the way this statute was amended in 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 79, sec. 15. In that Act, subsection (3) of this statute was inadvertently deleted and subsection (2) of this statute was inadvertently repeated, then amended. This change has been made under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h). (1/13/93).  Pursuant to KRS 7.136(1)(e), the prior reference to KRS 118A.110 which appeared in subsection (1) of this statute has been deleted because of the repeal of KRS 118A.110 by 1992 Ky. Acts ch. 454, sec. 2, effective July 14, 1992. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:05</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=27695</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

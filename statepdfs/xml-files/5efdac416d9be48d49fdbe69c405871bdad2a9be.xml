The same shall constitute the "sinking fund" referred to in KRS 67A.710 to 67A.825. The funds shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account, at the rate of interest prevailing at the time of such deposit. When the bonds become due, funds shall be transferred to the account from which the bonds shall be paid. </text><history>Created 1974 Ky.

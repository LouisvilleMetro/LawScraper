Acts ch. 422, sec. 1, effective April 7, 1998. </history><metadata><effective> April 7, 1998 </effective><lrc-note> (7/15/98).  In codifying this statute, the phrase "As used in this section" in 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 422, sec. 1, has been treated as if it read "As used in this Act." Otherwise, the definitions in Section 1 of that Act, which are used in Sections 2 and 3 (KRS 452.453 and 454.455) would be without effect. It is clear from context that this is what must have been intended in drafting this Act.

Children with disabilities may be included who live less than this distance from school. The aggregate and average daily attendance referred to in this subsection shall be the aggregate and average daily attendance of transported pupils the prior year adjusted for current year increases in accordance with Kentucky Board of Education administrative regulations. </section><section prefix="4">The square miles of area served by transportation shall be determined by subtracting from the total area in square miles of the district the area not served by transportation in accordance with administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education. However, if one (1) district authorizes another district to provide transportation services for a part of its area, this area shall be deducted from the area served by the authorizing district and added to the area served by the district actually providing the transportation. </section><section prefix="5">The density of transported pupils per square mile of area served for each district shall be determined by dividing the average daily attendance of transported pupils by the number of square miles of area served by transportation. </section><section prefix="6">The chief state school officer shall determine the average cost per pupil per day of transporting pupils in districts having a similar density by constructing a smoothed graph of cost for the density groups required by subsection (1). This graph shall be used to construct a scale showing the average costs of transportation for districts having a similar density of transported pupils. Costs shall be determined separately for county school districts and independent school districts. No independent school district will receive an average cost per pupil per day in excess of the minimum received by any county district or districts. These costs shall be the costs per pupil per day of transported pupils included in the public school fund and these costs shall be recalculated each biennium. </section><section prefix="7">The scale of transportation costs included in the fund to support education excellence in Kentucky for county and independent districts is determined in accordance with the provisions of KRS 157.310 to 157.440 for the biennium beginning July 1, 1990. </section><section prefix="8">The cost of transporting a district's pupils from the parent school to a state vocational-technical school or to a vocational educational center shall be calculated separately from the calculation required by subsections (1) through (7) of this section. The amount calculated shall be paid separately to each district from program funds budgeted for vocational pupil transportation, as a reimbursement based on the district's cost for providing this service. The amount of reimbursement shall be calculated in accordance with Kentucky Board of Education administrative regulations. In the event that the appropriation for vocational pupil transportation in the biennial budget is insufficient to meet the total calculated cost of this service for all districts, the amount paid to each district shall be ratably reduced. For the purpose of this subsection, the parent school shall be interpreted to mean that school in which the pupil is officially enrolled in a district's public common school system. </section><section prefix="9">The Kentucky Board of Education shall determine the type of pupil with a disability that qualifies for special type transportation to and from school. Those qualified pupils for which the district provides special type transportation shall have their aggregate days' attendance multiplied by five (5.0) and added to that part of the district's aggregate days' attendance that is multiplied by the district's adjusted cost per pupil per day in determining the district's pupil transportation program cost for allotment purposes. </section></text><history> Amended 1996 Ky.

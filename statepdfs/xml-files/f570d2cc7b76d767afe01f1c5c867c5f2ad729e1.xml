Acts ch.11, sec.5, indicated that this section was to be codified as a new section of KRS Chapter 12, the statute has been placed in KRS Chapter 171 because, given the subject matter of the section, KRS Chapter 171 is the more logical placement. See KRS 7.136. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:48</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=4868</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

Acts ch. 10, sec. 1, which amends this section, shall be known as the Robert L. Barnett, Jr. R. Ph. Act.  (7/15/98).  This section was amended by 1998 Ky. Acts chs. 297, 301, and 531 which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together. It is clear that the intent of both 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 297, sec. 4, and ch. 301, sec. 27, was to change the subsection reference in KRS 217.015 for the definition of practitioner. In codifying these Acts, that result has been effectuated.

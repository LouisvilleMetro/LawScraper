In a petition for restitution or reparation, the court shall cause the defendant, if in custody, to be brought into court, and demand of him if he has any defense to make to the petition. If he consents to the restitution or to reparation in damages in an agreed sum, the court shall give judgment accordingly.

A failure to pursue this remedy shall not deprive the person aggrieved of his civil action for the injury sustained.  </text><history>Amended 1980 Ky.

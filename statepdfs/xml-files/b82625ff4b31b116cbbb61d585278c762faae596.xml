Acts ch. 361, sec. 1. </history><metadata><effective> July 13, 2004 </effective><lrc-note>(9/10/90).  Section 2 of the enrolled version of House Bill 301 of the 1990 Regular Session, 1990 Ky. Acts ch. 191, purported to amend KRS 177.035, but the inclusion of that section of the bill was the result of an error in enrolling a Senate amendment which was not accepted by the House and from which the Senate subsequently receded. Pursuant to KRS 446.017, Section 2 of the enrolled version of House Bill 301 is void and has been severed from that bill. The above statutory text is a recodification of KRS 177.035, as amended by the 1990 Regular Session, without the amendment contained in Section 2 of House Bill 301. The original 1990 codification of KRS 177.035 and its accompanying note are superseded and without effect. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:50</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=5235</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

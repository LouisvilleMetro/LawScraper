The board may prescribe the number of assistant engineers to be selected by the chief engineer. The chief engineer shall have control of the work until completed, or until his removal by the board, and may assign portions to each assistant. He may, with the consent of the board, consult any eminent engineer and obtain his opinion or advice concerning the drainage of the district. He may employ such assistants as are necessary to make a complete topographical survey of the district, and shall enter upon the ground and make a survey of the main drains and all the laterals. </section><section prefix="2">The line of each ditch, drain or levee shall be plainly and substantially marked on the ground. The course and distance of each ditch, and width of right-of-way, shall be carefully noted and sufficient notes made so that it may be accurately plotted and mapped. A line of levels shall be run for the entire work and sufficient data secured from which accurate profiles and plans may be made. Frequent bench marks shall be established along the line, on permanent objects, and their elevation recorded in the field books. Other levels may be run to determine the fall from one part of the district to another. If an old watercourse, ditch or channel is being altered it shall be accurately cross sectioned, so as to compute the amount of cubic yards saved by the use of the old channel. If a private ditch is utilized, the saving by reason of its use shall be carefully computed and reported, with the name of the owner. A drainage map of the district shall then be completed, showing the location of every improvement and the boundary, as closely as may be reasonably determined, of the lands owned by each individual landowner within the district. The location of any railroad or public highway and the boundary of any incorporated town or village within the district shall be shown on the map. There shall be prepared to accompany the map a profile showing the surface of the ground, and the bottom or grade of the proposed improvement. </section><section prefix="3">The engineer shall make an estimate of the cost of the work, and plans and specifications therefor, and file the same, together with all maps and profiles, with the county clerk, to be made a part of the record of the proceedings. All such maps, profiles, plans and specifications, together with the report of the engineer and all exhibits filed therewith, shall be made in duplicate, one to be marked original and the other duplicate. If lands in counties other than the one in which the proceeding is pending are affected, an additional copy of the maps and profiles shall be made and filed with the county clerk of the other counties. The original shall not be withdrawn from the custody of the clerk, but the duplicate may be withdrawn for use by the viewers, the board, or for use on the work by the engineer or contractor. This material shall be receipted for by the person withdrawing it, and returned promptly. </section></text><history>Recodified 1942 Ky. Acts ch. 208, sec. 1, effective October 1, 1942, from Ky.

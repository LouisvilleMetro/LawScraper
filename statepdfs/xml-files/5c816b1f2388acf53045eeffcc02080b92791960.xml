The driver of a vehicle, in obedience to a yield right-of-way sign shall yield right-of-way to vehicles not so obligated to yield or stop which are within the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard; but such driver, having so yielded, may proceed at such time as a safe interval occurs. </text><history>Created 1960 Ky.

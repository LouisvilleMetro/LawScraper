In addition to the payment of the renewal fee, the active licensee applying for a license renewal shall furnish to the board satisfactory evidence that he has attended an educational program in the year preceding each application for renewal. Satisfactory evidence of attendance of postgraduate study at an institution approved by the board shall be considered equivalent. Provided, however, that licenses may be renewed by the board, at its discretion, and the applicant may be excused from paying the renewal fee or attending the annual educational program, or both, in instances where the applicant submits an affidavit to the board evidencing that he, for good cause assigned, suffered a hardship which prevented the applicant from renewing the license or attending the educational program at the proper time. </section><section prefix="2">The board shall send a written notice to every person holding a valid license to practice chiropractic within this state at least forty-five (45) days prior to the first day of March in each year, directed to the last known address of the licensee, and shall enclose with the notice proper blank forms for application for annual license renewal. The board shall, within forty-five (45) days, notify every person failing to renew his license after it is due that he is delinquent and is subject to a late penalty of three hundred dollars ($300). If the licensee fails to renew his license within forty-five (45) days after the mailing of the delinquent notice then his license shall be revoked for nonrenewal.

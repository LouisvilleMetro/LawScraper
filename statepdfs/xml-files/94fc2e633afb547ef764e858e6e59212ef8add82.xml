This assurance shall be in writing and shall be filed with and subject to the approval of the Circuit Court in which the alleged violator resides or has his principal place of business, or the Franklin Circuit Court. An assurance of voluntary compliance shall not be considered an admission of violation for any purpose. It shall be a willful violation of KRS 367.170 if a person who enters into an assurance of voluntary compliance fails to comply. Matters thus closed may at any time be reopened by the Attorney General for further proceedings in the public interest, pursuant to KRS 367.190. </text><history> Amended 1996 Ky.

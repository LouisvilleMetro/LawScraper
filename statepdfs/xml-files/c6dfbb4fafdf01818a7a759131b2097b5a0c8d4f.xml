Acts ch. 413, sec. 4, indicated that a new section of KRS Chapter 17A was being created, it is clear from the subject matter of the section that it was intended instead to create a new section of Subtitle 17A of KRS Chapter 304. Under KRS 7.136(1), this manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected by codifying the section in Subtitle 17A of KRS Chapter 304. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:05</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=17408</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

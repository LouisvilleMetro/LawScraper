For refinanced projects constructed or renovated prior to July 1, 1994, the use allowance payment shall not change for the term of the original bond issue, unless there is a change in the space occupied. For court facilities renovated or constructed after July 1, 1994, "use allowance" means the court's proportional share of the annual principal and interest cost in connection with the renovation or construction, but not to exceed eight percent (8%) annually of capital costs, or, if there is no debt, four percent (4%) annually of capital costs.

After July 14, 2000, capital costs, for the purpose of computing the maximum annual use allowance, shall not exceed the project scope as authorized by the General Assembly in the judicial branch budget or as increased and approved under KRS 26A.164. </section><section prefix="4">"Capitalized renovation" means all remodeling involving the structural or mechanical systems, except for remodeling that involves substantial demolition of the original structure.

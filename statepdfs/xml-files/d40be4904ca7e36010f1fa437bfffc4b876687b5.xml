The written agreement shall require that each transaction terminate not more than one (1) year from its inception or upon the earlier demand of the insurer. The agreement shall be with the business entity counterparty, but for securities lending transactions, the agreement may be with an agent acting on behalf of the insurer, if the agent is a qualified business entity, and if the agreement: <section prefix="a">Requires the agent to enter into separate agreements with each counterparty that are consistent with the requirements of this section; and </section><section prefix="b">Prohibits securities lending transactions under the agreement with the agent or its affiliates. </section></section><section prefix="3">Cash received in a transaction under this section shall be invested in accordance with this subtitle and in a manner that recognizes the liquidity needs of the transaction or used by the insurer for its general corporate purposes.

For purposes of calculations made to determine compliance with this subsection, no effect will be given to the insurer's future obligation to resell securities, in the case of a repurchase transaction, or to repurchase securities, in the case of a reverse repurchase transaction. An insurer shall not enter into a transaction under this section if, as a result of and after giving effect to the transaction: <section prefix="a">The aggregate amount of securities then loaned, sold to, or purchased from any one (1) business entity counterparty under this section would exceed five percent (5%) of its admitted assets. In calculating the amount sold to or purchased from a business entity counterparty under repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions, effect may be given to netting provisions under a master written agreement; or </section><section prefix="b">The aggregate amount of all securities then loaned, sold to, or purchased from all business entities under this section would exceed forty percent (40%) of its admitted assets, but the limitation of this subsection shall not apply to reverse repurchase transactions for so long as the borrowing is used to meet operational liquidity requirements resulting from an officially declared catastrophe and subject to a plan approved by the commissioner. </section></section><section prefix="5">In a securities lending transaction, the insurer shall receive acceptable collateral having a market value as of the transaction date at least equal to one hundred two percent (102%) of the market value of the securities loaned by the insurer in the transaction as of that date. If at any time the market value of the acceptable collateral is less than the market value of the loaned securities, the business entity counterparty shall be obligated to deliver additional acceptable collateral, the market value of which, together with the market value of all acceptable collateral then held in connection with the transaction, at least equals one hundred two percent (102%) of the market value of the loaned securities. </section><section prefix="6">In a reverse repurchase transaction, other than a dollar roll transaction, the insurer shall receive acceptable collateral having a market value as of the transaction date at least equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the market value of the securities transferred by the insurer in the transaction as of that date. If at any time the market value of the acceptable collateral is less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the market value of the securities so transferred, the business entity counterparty shall be obligated to deliver additional acceptable collateral, the market value of which, together with the market value of all acceptable collateral then held in connection with the transaction, at least equals ninety-five percent (95%) of the market value of the transferred securities. </section><section prefix="7">In a dollar roll transaction, the insurer shall receive cash in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities transferred by the insurer in the transaction as of the transaction date. </section><section prefix="8">In a repurchase transaction, the insurer shall receive as acceptable collateral transferred securities having a market value at least equal to one hundred two percent (102%) of the purchase price paid by the insurer for the securities. If at any time the market value of the acceptable collateral is less than one hundred percent (100%) of the purchase price paid by the insurer, the business entity counterparty shall be obligated to provide additional acceptable collateral, the market value of which, together with the market value of all acceptable collateral then held in connection with the transaction, at least equals one hundred two percent (102%) of the purchase price.

Acts ch. 120 amended the opening sentence of this statute to insert "Section 12 of this Act" into the list of KRS sections whose terms govern the Legislatorsâ€™ Retirement Plan. Section 12 of that Act created KRS 21.402. However, the Reviser of Statutes has not inserted a specific reference to KRS 21.402 in this list, since the list contains a range of statutes (KRS 21.370 to 21.410) that includes KRS 21.402. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:14</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=42645</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

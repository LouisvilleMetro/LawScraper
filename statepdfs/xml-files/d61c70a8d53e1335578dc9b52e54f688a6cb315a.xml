The General Assembly recognizes that a child whose care, custody, and control has been assumed by the Commonwealth as evidenced by termination of the rights of the biological parents and adoption from state custody or a custodial commitment to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services or the Department of Juvenile Justice is a special ward of the state and faces particular challenges in pursuing higher education. Because it is the intent of the General Assembly to support adoption, foster parenting, and educational advancement, the purpose of KRS 164.2847 is to provide postsecondary education advancement opportunity for foster and adopted children who are or were wards of the state. </text><history> Amended 2005 Ky.

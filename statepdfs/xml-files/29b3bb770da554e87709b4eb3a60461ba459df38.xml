Acts ch. 211, sec. 121, effective July 12, 2006. -- Created 2000 Ky. Acts ch. 308, sec. 3, effective July 14, 2000. </history><metadata><effective> July 12, 2006 </effective><lrc-note>(6/25/2013). In codification, a reference to the Early Childhood Business Council has been removed from the list in this statute of agencies the Department of Education must provide staffing and administrative support to because the statute creating the Early Childhood Business Council (KRS 200.709) was repealed in 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 57, sec. 10. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected this manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h).(6/25/2013). A reference to the "Early Childhood Development Authority" in this statute has been changed in codification to the "Early Childhood Advisory Council" to reflect the reorganization of certain parts of the Executive Branch, as set forth in Executive Order 2012-586 and confirmed by the General Assembly in 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 57.</lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:42</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=7337</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

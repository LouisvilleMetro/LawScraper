Acts ch. 94, sec. 8, effective July 15, 2008. </history><metadata><catchline-at-repeal>  Biennial assessment for administration costs. </catchline-at-repeal><lrc-note> (7/1/2010).  This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24, sec. 81, effective July 15, 2010. However, 2008 Ky. Acts ch. 94, sec. 9 repealed this section effective July 1, 2010. Pursuant to KRS 446.100(2), the 2008 repeal of this section prevails over the 2010 amendment, since the 2008 repeal was not itself repealed prior to its effective date. The 2010 amendments made to this section will be given no effect, as they would have taken effect after the 2008 repeal. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:10</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=25574</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

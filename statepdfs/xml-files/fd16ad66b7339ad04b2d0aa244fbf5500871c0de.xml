The General Assembly finds that adequate information is not available for each session through which the members of the Legislature can determine the needs of the various agencies and departments of the state government, and the effectiveness of their programs. The General Assembly also finds that the legislative session is not adequate time in which to review the financial operations of each agency. It is the intent of KRS 7.310 to 7.380 to provide the Legislature with adequate factual information by which to exercise its valid powers. </text><history>Amended 1974 Ky.

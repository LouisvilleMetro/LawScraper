If the urban-county council of the government has determined that all benefited properties within classified zones are substantially equally benefited and that all therein shall be assessed equally, the same assessment levy shall be made against each benefited property within a classified zone.  In other cases, if any, the sum necessary to be raised annually for amortization of the bonds shall be levied and assessed against the benefited properties in the proportion that the assessed value of each individual lot, parcel or tract for urban-county government ad valorem taxation shall bear to the whole assessed value of all the benefited properties as shown by the records upon which urban-county government ad valorem taxation may from time to time be based.  Where there is no such record, as in the case of public property or property owned by religious, charitable or educational institutions, the same (except that owned by the United States government) shall be specially assessed by the proper assessing officers and for such special assessment reasonable compensation shall be paid.  Any such special assessment shall be subject to all procedures for equalization and judicial review as may be provided by law in connection with ordinary assessments. </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

If, in attempting to reclaim the fugitive, the agent is acting within the course and scope of his employment, the amount due shall be paid over to the agent's employer instead of the agent. When a fugitive is to be returned to this state from a location out of state which is in excess of five hundred (500) miles from the jail to which he is to be returned, commercial air transportation may be utilized in lieu of ground transportation, unless the agent undertaking the transportation decides to utilize ground transportation. Payment for air transportation shall be in lieu of the mileage payment for ground transportation only for that portion of the journey for which air transportation is used. Ground transportation and other expenses shall be paid as authorized herein. If the agent is not given possession of the fugitive for reasons beyond the agent's control, he, or his employer, shall nevertheless be allowed the compensation prescribed by this section. Upon the return of the fugitive to the county in which the jail named in the proclamation is located, the person having him in charge shall go before a judge, who shall issue a mittimus to the jailer to receive the prisoner and keep him until he is discharged. </text><history> Amended 2000 Ky.

Often such persons cannot find others able or willing to render assistance.  The General Assembly intends, through this chapter, to establish a system of protective services designed to fill this need and to assure their availability to all adults.  It is also the intent of the General Assembly to authorize only the least possible restriction on the exercise of personal and civil rights consistent with the person's needs for services, and to require that due process be followed in imposing such restrictions. </text><history>Created 1980 Ky.

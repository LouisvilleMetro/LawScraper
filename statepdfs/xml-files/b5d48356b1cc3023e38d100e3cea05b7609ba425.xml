It is further declared that the Commonwealth has an obligation to provide an equitable method whereby every insurer licensed to write personal liability insurance in Kentucky be required to meet this market demand.  It is the purpose of KRS 304.40-010 to 304.40-140 to define this obligation and provide a mandatory program to assure an adequate supply of health care liability insurance coverage in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

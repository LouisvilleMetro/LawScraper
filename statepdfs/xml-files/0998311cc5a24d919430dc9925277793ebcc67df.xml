Unless there is pending in the circuit court a suit to settle the estate such neglect or refusal shall be grounds for removal by the court. If the fiduciary fails to file such account within thirty days after the date fixed in said notice, no allowance shall be made for his services unless the court enters upon its minutes an order that such delay was justified. </text><history>Created 1942 Ky.

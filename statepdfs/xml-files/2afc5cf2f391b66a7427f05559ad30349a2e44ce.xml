The entity holding the right to maintain a railtrail over the corridor may, if it finds the easementâ€™s terms acceptable, yearly designate for the tax purposes of the party conveying the easement that the entity is holding the corridor pursuant to the authority granted to that entity in the easement as opposed to authority granted in KRS 277.400 or any similar law allowing railbanking under federal law. This designation shall not, however, affect in any way the legal right of that entity to hold the corridor pursuant to a federal or state railbanking law or the operation of those laws, and the right to maintain the railtrail on the land shall not lapse as the result of the extinguishment or modification of the easement. The easement, by its terms, may be limited in duration from year to year or for a set period of years, may extinguish itself upon the happening of a defined contingent future event, or may last in perpetuity. </text><history> Created 2000 Ky.

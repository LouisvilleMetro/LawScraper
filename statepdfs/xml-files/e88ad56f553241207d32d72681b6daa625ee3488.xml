In the absence of an agreement with the creditor to the contrary, the other person shall not be entitled to any dividend until the amount paid to the creditor on the undertaking plus the dividends paid on the claim from the insurer's estate to the creditor equals the amount of the entire claim of the creditor. Any excess received by the creditor shall be held by him in trust for such other person.  </text><history>Created 1970 Ky.

The provisions of KRS 304.42-010 to 304.42-190 were modeled after the Model Act of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on Life and Health Guaranty Associations, in which the following language appears after the word "insurer" in the text specified above: "attributable to cover losses should be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer." </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:58</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=30118</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

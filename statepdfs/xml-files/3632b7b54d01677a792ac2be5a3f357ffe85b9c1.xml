In codification, the Reviser of Statutes has corrected an inadvertent drafting error in subsection (1) of this statute by changing a reference to "KRS 236.260" as it appeared in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 102, sec. 8, to "KRS 230.260." KRS Chapter 230 is titled "Horse Racing and Showing" while KRS Chapter 236 is titled "Boiler and Pressure Vessel Safety." It is obvious that the bill drafter knew which statute (KRS 230.260) within KRS Chapter 230 relating to advance deposit account wagering licensing to refer to, but because of a typographical error mistakenly cited to KRS 236.260 instead. This correction has been made under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h).</lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:02</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=43403</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

The General Assembly declares that the purpose of KRS 200.501 to 200.509 is to establish a structure for coordinated policy development, comprehensive planning, and collaborative budgeting for services to children with an emotional disability or severe emotional disability and their families. It is further the intention of the General Assembly to build on the existing resources and to design and implement a coordinated service system for children with an emotional disability or severe emotional disability that is community based and centered on the needs of the individual child and family. Children with a severe emotional disability who are receiving institutional care or are at risk of institutional placement shall be given priority for services pursuant to KRS 200.501 to 200.509. </text><history>Amended 1992 Ky.

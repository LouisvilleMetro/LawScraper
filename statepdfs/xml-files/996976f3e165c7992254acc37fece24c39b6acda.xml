Although 2002 Ky. Acts ch. 274, sec. 10, has a reference to "Section 1 of this Act" (KRS 67A.360) in subsection (1)(a) of this statute, that reference has been codified as KRS 281.910 (which was sec. 9 of ch. 274) because amendments to the introduced version of the bill in the House inadvertently did not make the necessary adjustment to this internal reference. This failure was a manifest typographical or clerical error and has been corrected in codification under KRS 7.136(1)(h). </lrc-note><effective>June 24, 2015</effective><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-03</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:16:16</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=44215</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

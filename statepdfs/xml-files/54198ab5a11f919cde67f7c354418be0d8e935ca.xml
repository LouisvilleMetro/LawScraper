As part of the continuing growth of the population and the economic development of the Commonwealth, it is necessary and desirable that the overall impact on the natural ecology be considered when major alterations are proposed affecting same, and that certain areas of unusual natural significance be set aside and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations. Such unique areas are valuable as laboratories for scientific research, as reservoirs of natural materials not all of the uses of which are now known, as habitats for plant and animal species and biotic communities, as living museums of the native landscape where people may observe nature's web of life and our natural heritage, as places of historic and natural interest and scenic beauty, and as reminders of the vital human dependence upon fresh air, clean water, and unspoiled natural areas.  </section><section prefix="2">It is therefore the public policy of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to secure for the people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of natural areas by establishing a system of nature preserves, protecting these areas and gathering and disseminating information regarding them, establishing and maintaining a registry of natural areas, and otherwise encouraging and assisting in the preservation of natural areas and features. </section></text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

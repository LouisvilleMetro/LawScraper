He shall be the technical adviser of the board on matters regarding the operation of the funds of the system and shall perform such other duties as are required in connection therewith. At least once in each six (6) year period after the first year of operation of the system, the actuary shall make an actuarial investigation into the actuarial assumptions used, including but not limited to mortality, investment rate of return, and service and compensation of the members and beneficiaries of the retirement system; and make a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the funds of the system. At least annually the actuary shall make an actuarial valuation of the retirement system. The valuation shall include a description of the actuarial assumptions used, and the assumptions shall be reasonably related to the experience of the system and represent the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience. On the basis of the results of the valuations, the board of trustees shall make necessary changes in the retirement system within the provisions of law and shall recommend the contributions payable by the state within the limits specified in KRS 161.550. </section><section prefix="2">Actuarial factors and actuarial cost factor tables in use by the retirement system for all purposes shall be determined by the actuary of the retirement system and approved by the board of trustees by resolution and implemented without the necessity of an administrative regulation.

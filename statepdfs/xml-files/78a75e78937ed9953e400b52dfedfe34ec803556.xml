Costs of the project which may then be earned and payable, may be paid forthwith. There shall be set aside into the sinking fund, hereinafter created, a sum from bond proceeds equal to all interest which will accrue on said bonds until the date when the first improvement assessment levied in connection therewith will become due and payable. The remainder may be disbursed from time to time in payment of costs of the project, as herein defined, except that payments on account of the construction contracts shall not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the amount shown by a written certificate of the engineer to have been earned for materials furnished and/or labor performed by any contractor, the retained ten percent (10%) to be disbursed only upon final acceptance of the finished work of such contractor. If, after completion, acceptance and payment of the work of all contractors, and the payment of all costs of the improvement project, as herein defined, there shall remain an unexpended balance of bond proceeds, such balance shall be transferred to the sinking fund created and maintained in connection with the project, as provided in KRS 67A.800. The advanced installment and the one-half of one percent (0.5%) collected pursuant to KRS 67A.755 shall be part of the sinking fund. </text><history>Created 1974 Ky.

This section shall not be deemed to require, however, that such ordinance or resolution be adopted prior to interim financing of the project, if such interim financing was undertaken by the proposed lessee corporation upon the basis of discussions between the corporation and responsible officials of the issuer which were later formally ratified by the appropriate governing body of the issuer. </section><section prefix="2">The ordinance or resolution shall further provide that the industrial building or the pollution control facility is to be acquired pursuant to the provisions of KRS 103.200 to 103.285. Each such bond-authorizing ordinance or resolution shall be effective only after publication, in a newspaper authorized to publish official advertisements for the issuer, of the title to said ordinance or resolution, together with a statement signed by the clerk of the issuer setting forth the maximum amount of bonds to be outstanding at any one (1) time, the name of the lessee corporation, and the fact that the bonds are to be retired from the proceeds of either the lease payments as set forth in KRS 103.200 to 103.285, inclusive, or the loan payments or sale payments in the event the industrial building financing transaction is carried out pursuant to a loan agreement, sale agreement, or other tax incentive agreement. No publication of the complete ordinance or resolution shall be required, but said ordinance or resolution shall be entered upon the records of the issuer and shall be available for public inspection. </section><section prefix="3">Any industrial buildings financed by bonds pursuant to KRS 103.200 to 103.285 and leased in connection with the bond financing from a tax-exempt governmental unit, or tax-exempt statutory authority, shall require the prior approval by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority of the reduced ad valorem tax for industrial buildings under KRS 132.020, the standards for which the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority shall establish through its operating procedures or by the promulgation of administrative regulations in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A. The authority shall consider, along with other indicators, when establishing standards, the number of jobs to be created, the amount of capital to be invested, and the wages and benefits to be paid. </section><section prefix="4">The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority, any air board established pursuant to KRS 183.132, and any riverport authority established as provided in KRS 65.510 to 65.650, inclusive, shall have and possess all power and authority granted to cities and counties by the provisions of KRS 103.200 to 103.285, excluding condemnation powers under KRS 103.245, for the financing of industrial buildings. For such purposes, the terms "city," "county," and "issuer" as used in KRS 103.200 to 103.285, inclusive, shall also mean and refer to the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority, any air board established pursuant to KRS 183.132, and any riverport authority established as provided in KRS 65.510 to 65.650. The power and authority granted to the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority, any air board, and any riverport authority shall be and constitute an additional and alternative grant of power and authority to such governmental agencies, and shall not be construed as being in derogation of any other powers vested in each of such governmental agencies. </section></text><history> Amended 2014 Ky.

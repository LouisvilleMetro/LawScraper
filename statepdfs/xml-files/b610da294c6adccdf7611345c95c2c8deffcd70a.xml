Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except: <section prefix="1">Where the contract or other written agreement specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or </section><section prefix="2">Where the assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insured, has assumed such policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees. </section></section><section prefix="b">The reinsurance agreement may provide that the domiciliary liquidator of an insolvent ceding insurer shall give written notice to the assuming insurer of the pendency of a claim against such ceding insurer on the contract reinsured within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding. During the pendency of such claim, any assuming insurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defenses which it deems available to the ceding insurer or its liquidator. Such expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. Where two (2) or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose a defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement as though such expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer. </section></section><section prefix="6">Upon request of the commissioner an insurer shall promptly inform the commissioner in writing of the cancellation or any other material change of any of its reinsurance treaties or arrangements. </section><section prefix="7">Subsections (1) to (3) of this section shall apply to all cessions after July 14, 1992, under reinsurance agreements which have had an inception, anniversary, or renewal date not less than six (6) months after July 14, 1992. </section></text><history> Amended 2010 Ky.

Before adjudging that the fiduciary may deviate from the terms of the will or trust the court shall determine that there exist circumstances apparently unknown to the testator or settlor; that such circumstances would substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes intended; and that deviation is in the best interests of all parties concerned. </text><history>Amended 1982 Ky.

If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouseâ€™s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt. </section><section prefix="2">The warehouse may also reserve a security interest under Article 9 of this chapter against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (1) of this section, such as for money advanced and interest. A security interest is governed by Article 9 of this chapter. </section><section prefix="3">A warehouseâ€™s lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) of this section or a security interest under subsection (2) of this section is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid. However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not: <section prefix="a">Deliver or entrust the goods or any document covering the goods to the bailor or the bailorâ€™s nominee with actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell; or with power to obtain delivery under KRS 355.7-403; or with power of disposition under KRS 355.2A-304(2), 355.2A-305(2), 355.7-403, or 355.9-320 or other statute or rule of law; or </section><section prefix="b">Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document. </section></section><section prefix="4">A warehouseâ€™s lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection (1) of this section is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit. In this subsection, "household goods" means furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling. </section><section prefix="5">A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver. </section></text><history>Repealed and reenacted 2012 Ky.

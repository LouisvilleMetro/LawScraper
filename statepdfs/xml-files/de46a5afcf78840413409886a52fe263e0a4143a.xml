A judgment may be for the principal and accrued interest; but if rendered for accruing interest on a written obligation, it shall bear interest in accordance with the instrument reporting such accruals, whether higher or lower than twelve percent (12%). Provided, that when a claim for unliquidated damages is reduced to judgment, such judgment may bear less interest than twelve percent (12%) if the court rendering such judgment, after a hearing on that question, is satisfied that the rate of interest should be less than twelve percent (12%). All interested parties must have due notice of said hearing. </text><history>Amended 1982 Ky. Acts ch. 7, sec. 2, effective July 15, 1982. -- Amended 1976 Ky. Acts ch. 59, sec. 2. -- Amended 1942 Ky.

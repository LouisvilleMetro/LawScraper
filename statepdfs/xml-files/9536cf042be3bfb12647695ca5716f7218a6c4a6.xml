In such case the officer may pursue the person and make arrest anywhere within this state.  In the course of making a lawful arrest for a felony after such pursuit, he may use and apply that force which he believes is necessary to make the arrest, except that he may only use deadly force in making such an arrest if the conditions specified in KRS 61.916 are satisfied.

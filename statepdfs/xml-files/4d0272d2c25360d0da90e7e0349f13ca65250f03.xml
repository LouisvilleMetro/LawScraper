Underpayment, for purposes of this subsection, is determined by subtracting declaration credits allowed by KRS 141.070, declaration installment payments actually made, and credit for tax withheld as allowed by KRS 141.350 from seventy percent (70%) of the total income tax liability computed by the taxpayer as shown on the return filed for the tax year. This subsection shall not apply to the tax year in which the death of the taxpayer occurs, nor in the case of a farmer exercising an election under subsection (5) of KRS 141.305, nor in the case of any person having a tax liability of five hundred dollars ($500) or less. </section><section prefix="3">Any corporation or limited liability pass-through entity required by KRS 141.042 to file a declaration of estimated tax and required to pay the declaration of estimated tax by the installment method prescribed by subsection (1) of KRS 141.044 shall be subject to a penalty as provided in KRS 131.180 for any declaration underpayment or any installment not paid on time. Declaration underpayment, for purposes of this subsection, is determined by subtracting five thousand dollars ($5,000) and declaration payments actually made from seventy percent (70%) of the total tax liability due under KRS 141.040 and computed by the taxpayer on the return filed for the tax year. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, the penalty imposed by this subsection shall not apply if estimated payments made under subsection (1) of KRS 141.044 are equal to the amount of tax due under KRS 141.040 for the previous taxable year, and the amount of tax due under KRS 141.040 for the previous year was equal to or less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). </section><section prefix="4">Every tax imposed by this chapter, and all increases, interest, and penalties thereon, shall become, from the time it is due and payable, a personal debt to the state from the taxpayer or other person liable therefor. </section><section prefix="5">In addition to the penalties herein prescribed, any taxpayer or employer, who willfully fails to make a return or willfully makes a false return, or who willfully fails to pay taxes owing or collected, with intent to evade payment of the tax or amount collected, or any part thereof, shall be guilty of a Class D felony. </section><section prefix="6">Any person who willfully aids or assists in, or procures, counsels, or advises the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under this chapter of a return, affidavit, claim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter, whether or not the falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return, affidavit, claim, or document, shall be guilty of a Class D felony. </section><section prefix="7">A return for the purpose of this section shall mean and include any return, declaration, or form prescribed by the department and required to be filed with the department by the provisions of this chapter, or by the rules and regulations of the department or by written request for information to the taxpayer by the department. </section></text><history> Amended 2006 (1st Extra.

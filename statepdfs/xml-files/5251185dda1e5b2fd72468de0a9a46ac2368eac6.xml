The statement of exceptions shall be tried, but shall be limited to the questions which are raised in the original statements of the exceptions, or as amended, but the owner shall not be permitted to raise any question, nor shall the court reconsider any question so raised, concerning the right of the petitioner to condemn the property. All questions of fact pertaining to the amount of compensation to the owner, or owners, shall be determined by a jury, which jury on the motion of either party shall be sent by the court, in the charge of the sheriff, to view the land and material. After a jury trial, and if possession previously has not been taken by the condemnor of the land and material condemned, it may do so upon the payment to the owner or to the clerk of the Circuit Court the amount of the compensation adjudged by the Circuit Court to be due the owner. </section><section prefix="2">Appeals may be taken to the Court of Appeals from the final judgment of the Circuit Court as in other cases except that an appeal by the owner shall not operate as a supersedeas. </section><section prefix="3">The payment by the condemnor of the amount of compensation awarded and the taking possession of the lands and material condemned shall not prejudice its right to except from the award of the commissioners or the judgment of any court, nor shall the acceptance by the owner of the amount of the compensation awarded prejudice his right to except from the award of the commissioners or the judgment of any court. </section><section prefix="4">All costs in the Circuit Court shall be adjudged against the condemnor. </section><section prefix="5">If the condemnor takes possession of the property condemned and the amount of compensation is thereafter increased over that awarded by the commissioners, the condemnor shall pay interest to the owner at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum upon the amount of such increase from the date the condemnor took possession of the property. If the condemnor takes possession of the property condemned and the amount of compensation is thereafter decreased below that awarded by the commissioners, the condemnor shall be entitled to a personal judgment against the owner for the amount of the decrease plus interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date the owner accepted the amount of compensation the condemnor paid into court or to the owner. If the owner at all times refuses to accept the payment tendered by the condemnor, no interest shall be allowed in the judgment against the owner for the amount of the decrease. </section><section prefix="6">Upon the final determination of exceptions, or upon expiration of thirty (30) days from entry of the interlocutory judgment if no exceptions are filed, the Circuit Court shall make such orders as may be proper for the conveyance of the title to the extent condemned, to the property, and shall enter such final judgment as may be appropriate. </section></text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

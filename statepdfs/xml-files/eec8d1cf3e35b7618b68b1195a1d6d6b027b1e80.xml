No action shall be taken pursuant to this section if the regional housing authority has outstanding any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, unless first, all holders of such evidences of indebtedness consent in writing to such action. If such action decreases the area of operation of the regional housing authority to only one (1) county, the authority shall thereupon constitute and become a housing authority for that county, in the same manner as though the authority were created pursuant to KRS 80.320, and the members of such county housing authority shall be thereupon appointed as provided for the appointment of members of a housing authority created for a county. </text><history>Created 1942 Ky.

However, the cost of constructing, owning, and operating capital facilities to meet the demand for those public services is becoming increasingly burdensome to cities, counties, urban-counties, and improvement districts and it is desirable that innovative financing mechanisms be made available to assist the communities of this Commonwealth in developing drinking water, water, and wastewater projects at reasonable cost. Private sector ownership and operation of capital facilities providing public services can result in cost savings to communities contracting for those public services. It is therefore in the best public interest of the Commonwealth and its citizens that cities, counties, urban-counties, and improvement districts be authorized to cause such services to be provided by private enterprise, and to contract with private owners or private owner/operators for providing the service to the public. </text><history>Created 1986 Ky.

Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly receives benefits and does not repay those benefits; and </section><section prefix="11">Benefits under subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply to a child who is a legally adopted survivor at the time of the death of the member.

The internal numbering of subsection (12) of this statute has been altered in codification by the Reviser of Statutes from the way it appeared in 2009 (1st Extra. Sess.) Ky. Acts ch. 1, sec. 94, to correct a manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of KRS 7.136.  (1/1/2007).  This section was amended by 2006 Ky. Acts chs. 6, 251, and 252. Where these Acts are not in conflict, they have been codified together. Where a conflict exists between Acts ch. 6 and chs. 251 and 252, Acts chs. 251 and 252, which were enacted by the General Assembly after Acts ch. 6, prevail under KRS 446.250.  (3/6/2006).  2006 Ky. Acts ch. 6, sec. 29, provides that this section applies retroactively to July 1, 2005. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:02</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=28747</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

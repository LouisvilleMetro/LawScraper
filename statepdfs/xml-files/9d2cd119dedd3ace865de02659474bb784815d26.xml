Acts ch. 109, sec. 21, effective July 13, 2004. </history><metadata><effective> July 13, 2004 </effective><lrc-note>(7/13/2004).  In 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 109, sec. 21, directed that this section be created as a new section of KRS Chapter 21, the statute has been codified in KRS Chapter 411 because it is clear from the subject matter of this statute, the structure of ch. 109, and the range created by ch. 109, secs. 21 to 27, that placement in KRS Chapter 411 was intended. See KRS 7.136(1)(a) and (h). (7/13/2004).  In 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 109, sec. 21, subsec. (4), "home inspector" is defined as "a person licensed in accordance with Sections 1 to 27 of this Act." Because the home inspector licensure provisions in ch. 109 are confined to Sections 1 to 20, and Sections 21 to 27 set forth notice and opportunity to repair procedures that must be followed prior to bringing an action for damages against a home inspector, the reference to Sections 1 to 27 in subsection (4) has been changed by the Reviser of Statutes to the statutes at which Sections 1 to 20 are codified. See KRS 7.136(1)(a) and (h). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:30</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=17802</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

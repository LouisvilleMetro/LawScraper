Acts ch. 45, sec. 8, and ch. 93, sec. 5, as having been amended, the amendment relettering paragraphs of this section in those acts became unnecessary when the Office of the Kentucky Attorney General requested that other changes be made to the rearrangement of the paragraphs of KRS 61.878, which was also amended in 2005 Ky. Acts chs. 45 and 93. The Statute Reviser made these changes under the authority of KRS 7.136.  (7/15/94).  This statute was amended by 1994 Ky. Acts chs. 265 and 470, which were companion bills and are substantively identical. These Acts have been codified together. For the few minor variations between the Acts, Acts ch. 470 prevails under KRS 446.250, as the Act which passed the General Assembly last. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:54</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=31240</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag><tag>suspect-parse</tag></tags></law>

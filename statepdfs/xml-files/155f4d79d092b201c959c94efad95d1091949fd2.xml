If a total or subtotal conflicts with the sum of the appropriation figures of which it consists, the amounts of the individual appropriations shall control. If a conflict of this nature arises, either as a result of an inadvertent error in initial entry of a total or subtotal or through an amendment to any of its component appropriations, the director of the Legislative Research Commission shall apprise the reviser of statutes in writing of the existence of and reason for the variation and of the correct amount of the total or subtotal. If the requested change is within the scope of this section, the reviser of statutes shall cause that corrected total or subtotal to be substituted in the Acts and journals of the General Assembly and in the Kentucky Revised Statutes. </text><history> Created 1994 Ky.

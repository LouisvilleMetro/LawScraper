This statute is the former KRS 95.885, as amended, renumbered by the Reviser of Statutes in 1974. Because of this renumbering, the phrase "the fund defined by KRS 95.851" has been substituted for the phrase "this fund" that appeared in the original text of the statute in 1958 Ky. Acts ch. 16, sec. 35. See KRS 7.136(1)(a). </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:17:09</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=26129</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

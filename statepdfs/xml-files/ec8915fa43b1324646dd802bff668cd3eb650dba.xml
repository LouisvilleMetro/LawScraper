If the land is separated from the improvement by the land of another, and the owners are unable to agree as to the terms on which the one may enter the land of the other and construct the drain or ditch, he may file his ancillary petition in the pending proceeding, and have the same condemned in the same manner as provided in the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky.

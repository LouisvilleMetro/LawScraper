Special meetings of the members of the association may be called by the board; it shall be the board's duty to call such meetings when ten percent (10%) of the members of the association file with the association secretary a petition demanding a special meeting and specifying the business to be considered at such meeting. Regular or special meetings may be held within or without the state. Notice of all meetings, except as otherwise provided by law or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, shall be mailed to each member at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, and in case of special meetings the notice shall state the purposes for which it is called, but the bylaws may provide that all notices, except of proposed amendments to the articles of incorporation, may be given by publication in a periodical or newsletter published by or for the association of which substantially all its members are recipients, or in newspapers whose combined circulation is general in the territory in which the association operates. </text><history>Amended 1984 Ky.

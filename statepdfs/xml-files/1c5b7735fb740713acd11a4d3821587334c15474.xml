Each insurer paying a risk assessment under KRS 304.17B-021 may include the amount of the assessment in establishing premium rates filed with the commissioner under this section. The insurer shall identify any assessment allocated. </section><section prefix="g">The policy form filing of an insurer using the filing procedure with a minimum loss ratio guarantee will disclose to the enrollee, member, or subscriber as prescribed by the commissioner an explanation of the lifetime loss ratio guarantee, and the actual loss ratio, and any adjustments for duration. </section><section prefix="h">The insurer who elects to use the filing procedure with a minimum loss ratio guarantee shall notify all policyholders of the refund calculation, the result of the refund calculation, the percent of premium on an aggregate basis to be refunded if any, any amount of the refund attributed to the payment of interests, and an explanation of amounts less than ten dollars ($10). </section><section prefix="i">Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, an insurer may amend the policy forms used before March 31, 2005, or may amend the minimum loss ratio guarantee on policy forms filed with the department and used by the insurer prior to March 31, 2005, to provide for a minimum loss ratio guarantee allowed under this subsection for policies issued, delivered, or renewed on or after March 31, 2005. </section></section><section prefix="7">The commissioner may by administrative regulation prescribe any additional information related to rates, fees, dues, and other charges as they relate to the factors set out in subsection (3) of this section that he or she deems necessary and relevant to be included in the filings and the form of the filings required by this section.

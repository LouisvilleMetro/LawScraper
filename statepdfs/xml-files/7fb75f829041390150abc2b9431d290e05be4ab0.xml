The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this article, and in particular: <section prefix="a">Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but </section><section prefix="b">Unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods. </section></section><section prefix="2">Where the case is within KRS 355.2-504 respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions. </section><section prefix="3">Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. </section><section prefix="4">Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved: <section prefix="a">Tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgement by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; but </section><section prefix="b">Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a written direction to the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender. </section></section><section prefix="5">Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents: <section prefix="a">He must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of KRS 355.2-323); and </section><section prefix="b">Tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection. </section></section></text><history>Amended 2012 Ky.

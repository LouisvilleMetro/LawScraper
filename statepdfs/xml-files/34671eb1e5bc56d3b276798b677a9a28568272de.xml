If the demand for correction has specified two or more statements as false and defamatory, the correction may deal with some of such statements pursuant to (a) above and with other of such statements pursuant to (b) above.  </section><section prefix="4">A "conspicuous publication" in a visual or sound radio broadcast is a publication which is broadcast at substantially the same time of day, and with the same sending power, as the statement or statements specified as false and defamatory in the demand for correction. A publication in a particular manner which is agreeable to the plaintiff shall in any event be deemed "conspicuous."  </section><section prefix="5">A "timely publication" in a visual or sound radio broadcast is a publication within one business day after the day on which a sufficient demand for correction is received by the defendant. A "business day" is any day other than a Sunday or legal holiday. A publication on a particular day which is agreeable to the plaintiff shall in any event be deemed "timely."  </section><section prefix="6">"Special damages" are pecuniary damages which the plaintiff alleges and proves that he has suffered in respect to his property, business, trade, profession, or occupation (including such amounts of money as the plaintiff alleges and proves he has expended as a proximate result of the alleged defamation), and no other.  </section></text><history>Created 1956 Ky.

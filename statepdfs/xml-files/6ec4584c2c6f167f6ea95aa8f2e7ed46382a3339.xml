Acts ch. 158, sec. 79, effective July 12, 2012. -- Amended 1996 Ky. Acts ch. 369, sec. 9, effective July 15, 1996. -- Amended 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 265, sec. 11, effective July 15, 1994; ch. 352, sec. 14, effective July 15, 1994; and ch. 470, sec. 11, effective July 15, 1994. â€“ Amended 1992 Ky. Acts ch. 330, sec. 1, effective July 14, 1992. -- Amended 1976 Ky. Acts ch. 305, sec. 1. -- Created 1974 Ky. Acts ch. 279, sec. 7. </history><metadata><effective> July 12, 2012 </effective><lrc-note>(7/12/2012). In subsection (1) of this statute, an erroneous citation to a provision of the Kentucky Revised Statutes has been corrected. Subsection (11) of 2012 Ky. Acts ch. 158, sec. 79, refers to "subsection (5) of Section 1 of this Act" rather than making the clearly intended reference to "subsection (5) of Section 77 of this Act." Under KRS 7.136(1), the Reviser of Statutes has corrected this manifest clerical or typographical error. The reference now reads "KRS 335.010(5)." (7/15/94). This statute was amended by 1994 Ky. Acts chs. 265 and 470, which were companion bills and are substantively identical. These Acts have been codified together. For the few minor variations between the Acts, Acts ch. 470 prevails under KRS 446.250, as the Act which passed the General Assembly last. 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 352, sec. 14 is not in conflict with these two Acts and has been codified together with them. </lrc-note><pdf-author>ganesan_m</pdf-author><pdf-creation-date>2015-07-02</pdf-creation-date><pdf-download-date>2016-03-18 12:15:49</pdf-download-date><original-link>http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=40970</original-link></metadata><tags><tag>computer-parsed</tag><tag>unverified</tag></tags></law>

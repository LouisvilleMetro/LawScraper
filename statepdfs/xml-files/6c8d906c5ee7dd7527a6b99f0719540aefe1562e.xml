The stop shall be made not less than fifteen (15) feet nor more than fifty (50) feet from the nearest track over which the highway crosses, except where the crossing is protected by gates or a flagman employed by the railroad. After making the stop, the operator shall open the service door and carefully look in each direction and listen for approaching trains or maintenance vehicles before proceeding. If visibility is impaired at the required distance for stopping under this section, the operator may allow the vehicle to slowly roll forward for the purpose of gaining the visibility necessary to safely cross the railroad tracks. </text><history> Amended 2003 Ky.

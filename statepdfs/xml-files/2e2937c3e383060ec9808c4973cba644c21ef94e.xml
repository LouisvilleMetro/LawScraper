Liability to third persons for any act, omission or obligation of a trustee of a business trust, when acting in such capacity shall extend to the whole of the trust estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to discharge such obligation, but no trustee shall be personally liable for any such act, omission or obligation unless said act, omission or obligation constitute fraud or bad faith.

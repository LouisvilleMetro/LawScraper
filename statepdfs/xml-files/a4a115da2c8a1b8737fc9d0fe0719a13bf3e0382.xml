This system shall not limit or extend the applicant's or registrant's rights. An application for registration of a mark may include any or all goods upon which, or services with which, the mark is actually being used indicating the appropriate class or classes of goods or services. When a single application includes goods or services falling in multiple classes, the Secretary may require payment of the application fee of ten dollars ($10) for each class. To the extent practical, the classification of goods and services shall conform to the classification adopted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. </text><history> Created 1994 Ky.

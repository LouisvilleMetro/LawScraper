The authority hereby conferred upon urban-county governments is not intended, nor shall it be construed, to be in derogation or substitution of any authority otherwise conferred upon any urban-county government, but is alternative and in addition thereto.  If any urban-county government has undertaken any proceedings under any other law to acquire a project, it may abandon such proceedings and proceed under the provisions of KRS 67A.871 to 67A.894.  It is the purpose of KRS 67A.871 to 67A.894 to extend permissive authority to urban-county government to finance wastewater collection projects according to the assessed value basis, whereby benefited properties shall be assessed the cost of such projects according to benefits conferred upon the properties. </text><history>Created 1976 Ky.

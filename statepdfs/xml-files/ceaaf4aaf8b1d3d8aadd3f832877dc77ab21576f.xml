The department shall keep a record of such extensions. Except where a taxpayer is abroad, no extension shall be granted for more than six (6) months, and in no case for more than one (1) year. If any extension operates to postpone a tax payment, interest at the tax interest rate as defined in KRS 131.010(6) shall be collected. The department may condition the extension upon a bond sufficient to cover any tax and penalty determined to be due. The department may, on request, permit a person to file a tax return or report or pay tax on a date other than that prescribed by statute, or to change the fiscal period covered by such return or report, if the variation will not ultimately effect a reduction in revenue. </text><history> Amended 2005 Ky.
